I've already prepared some for you from the Survey of London website and have saved it in a file called 'sugar_docs.json' inside a folder called 'data'. (If you'd like to learn how to do it yourself, there's an extra notebook inside the folder which contains this one called 'Importing Data'). \n\nTo start working with it, we'll use Python's built-in ```open``` function to open the file and extract the data.

This, which '\n          'became Matfelon, may derive from a family name; Richard Matefelun, '\n          'a wine merchant, is said to have been present in the area in 1230. '\n          'If this is the derivation (matfelon as meaning knapweed is the '\n          'least preposterous of numerous suggested alternatives), it was '\n          'presumably in recognition of a pious benefaction, whether prompted '\n          'by local need or not. It does seem clear that there would have been '\n          'significant population growth in the area, and that the existing '\n          'parish church of St Dunstan, Stepney, aside from being distant had '\n          'been outgrown. Parish status was granted by 1320, the vicarage '\n          'being in the gift of the Rector of Stepney. [^1]\\xa0</p>\\n'\n          '\\n'\n          '<p>Archaeological evidence indicates that the church, always '\n          'aligned to the adjacent road and not properly oriented,\\xa0was of '\n          'clunch or white chalk rubble. It thus, no doubt, came to be known '\n          'as the ‘white chapel’, an appellation in use by 1344. Clunch was '\n          'not uncommon in medieval churches, especially to the east and north '\n          'of London, though it is friable so was often mixed with other '\n          'materials. The building was reportedly wrecked in a storm and '\n          'restored in 1362 thanks, it is said, to a papal Bull negotiated by '\n          'the absentee rector, Sir David Gower, a Canon of St Patrick’s '\n          'Cathedral, Dublin, that promised sinners a remission of penance for '\n          'visiting Whitechapel with an offering. There were four priests in '\n          '1416 indicating a large congregation or at least a prospering '\n          'parish. Documentation of legacies and archaeological investigation '\n          'both point to fifteenth-century improvements, to the fabric of '\n          'doors and windows if not more. [^2] Exceptionally, there were no '\n          'chantries at the Reformation, when, in 1548 there were 670 '\n          'communicants. [^3]</p>\\n'\n          '\\n'\n          '<p>Little is known about the form of the medieval church. It '\n          'appears to have had a four-bay nave to which a three-stage '\n          'crenellated tower and a north aisle and porch might have been '\n          'fifteenth-century additions. George Birch’s claim from inspection '\n          'of wall footings in 1876 that the medieval church was co-extensive '\n          'with that of the seventeenth century seems doubtful, if only '\n          'because it is known that a south ‘aisle’ was added in 1591. This '\n          'was, it seems, separately roofed, and almost as tall as the nave, '\n          'though not as wide, and possibly not as long. More a room than an '\n          'aisle it would have generated not just more seating for a growing '\n          'congregation, but also a much more auditory and less processional '\n          'interior. That would have been in keeping with the Calvinist norms '\n          'of the late sixteenth century that were strongly represented in '\n          'east London and firmly upheld by Richard Gardiner (or Gardner), '\n          'Whitechapel’s rector from 1570 to 1617. [^4]</p>\\n'\n          '\\n'\n          '<p>Protestantism had sparked early in Whitechapel, through the '\n          'celebrated challenge Richard Hunne, a merchant tailor and probably '\n          'a Lollard, had presented to the claimed rights of the rector, '\n          'Thomas Dryfield, in 1511, and through John Harrydance, the '\n          'Whitechapel bricklayer, arrested in 1539 for preaching from his '\n          'window. [^5] Gardiner, in whose time the vestry sold off the church '\n          'organ, was prominent among Elizabethan puritans and was embroiled '\n          'in high-level religious–political controversy in the immediate run '\n          'up to the extension of his church in 1591.

He oversaw the insertion of a gallery in the '\n          'south aisle which suggests that capacity was already again '\n          'stretched. It bore a panel to commemorate the failure in 1623 of '\n          'the Spanish Match. Crashawe died in 1626, preceded by 1,100 of his '\n          'parishioners in the plague year of 1625. His successor in what his '\n          'will called the ‘too greate Parishe’ of Whitechapel was John '\n          'Johnson, another puritan, but one who married the daughter (Judith '\n          'Meggs) of a wealthy parishioner in 1627 and trimmed thereafter to '\n          'align with the Laudian tide. [^7] Johnson moved the communion table '\n          'to the east end of the church, and undertook repairs in 1633–4 with '\n          '£300 raised from parishioners and more from the Haberdashers’ '\n          'Company, which in making the grant took into account the relative '\n          'poverty of the parish. These works left the church ‘within and '\n          'without, and in every part of it, Richly and very worthily '\n          'beautify’d’. [^8]</p>\\n'\n          '\\n'\n          '<p>Johnson was among the first London clergy to be deprived of his '\n          'living in 1641. Laud had strong local opposition. In the early '\n          '1640s Thomas Lambe’s General Baptists formed in Whitechapel what '\n          'was at the time ‘easily the most visible and notorious of all '\n          'sectarian congregations in London’. [^9] After contested elections '\n          'for parish overseers and violent confrontations in the church in '\n          '1646, Whitechapel’s Independents gained control and gathered under '\n          'a new rector, Thomas Walley (or Whalley). When the tables turned in '\n          '1660 Johnson was reinstated and a schism resulted, most of the '\n          'congregation departing to a meeting house in Brick Lane. In 1662 '\n          'Walley was arrested preaching elsewhere in Whitechapel; he soon '\n          'after emigrated to New England. [^10] Johnson was revealed as '\n          'corrupt and deprived of his living in 1668, chiefly through the '\n          'agency of his son-in-law, Ralph Davenant, who became the next '\n          'rector of Whitechapel. A fellow of Trinity Hall, Cambridge, and a '\n          'descendant of Bishop John Davenant, the moderate Calvinist who had '\n          'represented the English church at the synod of Dort in 1618, he was '\n          'also a cousin to Thomas Fuller. [^11]</p>\\n'\n          '\\n'\n          '<p>The largely medieval church was rebuilt in 1672–3. Davenant and '\n          'the vestry came to an agreement about the project in January 1672 '\n          'and work was probably complete by the end of 1673 which date was '\n          'carried on a stone tablet that remained on the east side of the '\n          'tower through subsequent rebuilds. The principal benefactor was '\n          'William Meggs, who had the parish’s largest house\\xa0where Johnson, '\n          'his brother-in-law, had lodged in the 1650s. Meggs had been a '\n          'member of Johnson’s vestry from 1660. These links with Johnson '\n          'notwithstanding, Crashawe’s panel of 1623 was relocated onto the '\n          'new south gallery and a monument to Crashawe himelf was '\n          'conspicuously re-erected on the north wall. Puritan inheritance was '\n          'not obscured. [^12] In its architectural form the new brick-built '\n          'church represented a rapprochement with moderate Nonconformity. It '\n          'reused some old footings and lower parts of the tower, but in its '\n          'regular cross-in-rectangle plan, 90ft by 63ft, with shallow '\n          'transept projections and angle quoins, it closely followed '\n          'pre-Restoration Calvinist models at Westminster Broadway and '\n          'Poplar. High-level round windows to north, south and east, perhaps '\n          'derived from Inigo Jones’s work of the 1630s at St Paul’s '\n          'Cathedral. The Serliana to the west also had pre-Restoration '\n          'precedents in London. There were transept pediments to north and '\n          'south, segmental pediments above inner-bay entrances to the north '\n          'and pine-cone finials. The less prominent south side was more '\n          'humbly finished, with an outer-bay entrance. The west door had '\n          'rusticated pilasters, cherub-head capitals and a pediment. '\n          'Architects and builders remain unknown, but there are '\n          'circumstantial reasons for suspecting involvement on the part of '\n          'Robert Hooke. [^13] The assuredly if impurely classical auditory '\n          'interior was ‘very lightsome and spacious’. [^14] The main '\n          'east-west axis was emphasized by three ribbed cross vaults '\n          'supported by four Portland stone Corinthian columns, their bases '\n          'obscured by box pews. There was a step up to the chancel, otherwise '\n          'only articulated by the inclusion of flanking vestries. A '\n          '‘Corinthian’ altarpiece was ‘much enriched’. Shallow north and '\n          'south galleries were probably original. A large black-and-white '\n          'marble aedicular mural monument to Meggs was erected after his '\n          'death in 1678.

The living was '\n          'reduced by the loss of Wapping from the parish in 1694, and the '\n          'liturgical politics of Whitechapel changed dramatically in 1697 '\n          'with the appointment of the Rev. Richard Welton, a high-church Tory '\n          'and Jacobite. Welton attacked Nonconformity and spurned the area’s '\n          'recent Huguenot immigrants: ‘This set of rabble are the very offal '\n          'of the earth, who cannot be content to be safe here from that '\n          'justice and beggary from which they fled, and to be fattened on '\n          'what belongs to the poor of our own land to grow rich at our '\n          'expense, but must needs rob us of our religion too.’ [^16] He made '\n          'beautifying alterations, moving the font and altering pews, oversaw '\n          'the casting of six new bells by Phelps’s local foundry in 1709, and '\n          'attracted high-profile controversy in 1713 when he placed a '\n          'painting of the Last Supper by John Fellowes in the church as an '\n          'altarpiece. Judas was prominently represented as a likeness of '\n          'Bishop White Kennett, an antagonist of Welton’s. Through the Bishop '\n          'of London, Kennett saw to the altarpiece’s removal in 1714. The '\n          'same phase of works included an organ by Christopher Schreider, '\n          'perhaps also the west gallery in which it stood. The organ case was '\n          'later described as ‘carved and gilt, with carved oak trusses and '\n          'gilt cherubim, surmounted by four richly-carved and gilt figures’ '\n          '[^17] The gallery front sported a finely carved wood panel '\n          'depicting King David playing the harp flanked by musical '\n          'instruments.

'\n          '[^19] These did not materialize, but under a succession of '\n          'latitudinarian rectors Whitechapel’s church appears to have steered '\n          'clear of further controversy making it a quieter but duller place. '\n          'It was ‘repaired and Beautified’ in 1735 and again repaired, in '\n          'what was a wealthy parish, with funds raised through an Act of '\n          'Parliament in 1762–3 when the tower, possibly unstable, was to have '\n          'been cased in Portland stone – it was probably rendered instead. '\n          'The clock stage gained aedicules and a large cupola took the place '\n          'of the small bell turret. Similarities with the exactly '\n          'contemporary St George’s German Lutheran Church on Alie Street '\n          'suggest that the carpenter–architect Joel Johnson may have been in '\n          'charge of this project.

Then in 1806 the pulpit was moved '\n          'and there were more repairs for £4,133 11 2½, with James Carr as '\n          'surveyor. These works probably included a cornice on the tower. '\n          'Structural repairs involving iron tie rods and costing £1,113 13 3½ '\n          'followed in 1825–6, with John Shaw (the elder) as surveyor. Even '\n          'so, the tower became dangerous. James Savage acted as surveyor for '\n          'yet further repairs in 1829–30, for £1,686 8 4. In 1839 Edward '\n          'Blore reported on the state of the church and recommended '\n          'rebuilding. Discussion was adjourned for a year, but not resumed, '\n          'the notion presumably deemed too costly. [^22] The tower was again '\n          'repaired in 1865, and given a new cast-iron bell frame made by '\n          'Mears &amp; Co.

The offer '\n          'was initially accepted with great relief and joy, but Coope had '\n          'soon to defend the proposed use of red brick, averring, wrongly, '\n          'that ‘our great church architect Street invariably uses it’. [^25] '\n          'It was in fact to James Brooks’s recent red-brick churches in '\n          'Haggerston, St Columba and St Chad, that a Vestry committee led by '\n          'the Rev.

They '\n          'were not impressed, convinced in their dislike of red brick, and '\n          'anyway keen to have a larger church. Overall costs were estimated '\n          'to be about £6,000 more than Coope was offering. Cohen’s committee '\n          'concluded in September, with diminished alacrity, that ‘it is '\n          'expedient that the offer of Mr Coope be accepted.’ [^26] Rebuilding '\n          'began in 1875 when Cohen was succeeded by the Rev.

Chappell, of Little George Street, '\n          'Westminster, work was completed in October 1876 and there was a '\n          'consecration in February 1877. The upper stage of the tower and '\n          'spire followed in 1878, built by Edward Conder of Kingsland Basin. '\n          'The estimated total final cost had risen to about £30,000 of which '\n          'it was later said around £10,000 came from public subscription, the '\n          'rest from Coope. [^27]</p>\\n'\n          '\\n'\n          '<p>The large brick church comprised a nave (109ft long and 78ft '\n          'high) and aisles, a round-apsed chancel, a baptistery under a west '\n          'gallery and a three-stage north-west tower with an octagonal spire '\n          'and corner turrets rising 175ft in all, sited so as to be prominent '\n          'on the main road. It extended further west and south than had its '\n          'predecessor and was set less squarely to the road, to minimise '\n          'disturbance of the graveyard and avoid building on southerly ground '\n          'that was only leasehold. While adhering to red brick, Lee had '\n          'amended his plans. The church had only 1,250 sittings and omitted a '\n          'full-height north transept in favour of a gabled organ bay at the '\n          'east end of the north aisle. An unusual feature, reflecting the '\n          'local mission and a memorial to Champneys, was an external pulpit, '\n          'placed on a staircase turret at the north-west corner of the nave. '\n          'There was a large ‘church room’ to the south-east in which relics '\n          'from the old church were displayed. The interior had ornamentally '\n          'carved Bath stone dressings to naked brick surfaces (perhaps '\n          'intended for decoration), Minton floor tiles and a ceiled '\n          'wagon-vault, a form chosen for auditory reasons, ill-advisedly as '\n          'the building had very poor acoustics. The old clock and bells were '\n          'reset. Lee deployed thirteenth-century style details and himself '\n          'designed fittings including the pulpit, lectern, font and a mosaic '\n          'apse floor, executed by Burke &amp; Co. of Regent Street. Horatio '\n          'Walter Lonsdale, Lee’s brother-in-law, supplied stained-glass '\n          'windows. Stone carving was by Thomas Earp of Lambeth. [^28]</p>\\n'\n          '\\n'\n          '<p>This church was short-lived, suddenly gutted by fire on a '\n          'summer’s Thursday afternoon, on 27 August 1880. Flames in the organ '\n          'chamber swept up the organ pipes into the timber roof. The tower '\n          'survived. Kitto and Gadesden led an approach to Coope, still an MP, '\n          'who undertook to use his influence to secure the insurance cover of '\n          '£16,800 and to stump up further rebuilding costs. The acoustical '\n          'shortcomings of the destroyed interior led him to make replacement '\n          'conditional on a redesign by Lee. [^29] The church was rebuilt in '\n          '1881–2 on the same plan, but with a polygonal apse and an open '\n          'pseudo-hammerbeam roof beneath a lower ridge which did bring '\n          'acoustical success. The nave west wall was given three windows in '\n          'place of two, and there were other detailed variations that '\n          'favoured a style more characteristic of the fourteenth century. The '\n          'interior was yet more richly sculpted than its predecessor, and '\n          'this time lavishly decorated with stencilling that shows the '\n          'influence of Burges. Conder was the builder and Lonsdale supervised '\n          'painting and glass.

'\n          '[^32] Yet this was among the best attended of East London churches, '\n          'with fully choral services and psalms chanted morning and evening. '\n          'By 1884 Robinson’s team included two Missioners to Jews, the Rev. '\n          'J. H. Bruhl and the Rev. A. Bernstein. The open-air pulpit was in '\n          'regular use, and by the 1890s and well into the twentieth century '\n          'special services were conducted for Jews in Hebrew and German, with '\n          'sermons preached in Yiddish to congregations of up to 500. A last '\n          'notable rector was the Rev. John A. Mayo, who gave the first radio '\n          'sermon in 1922.

Shute Adams, druggist, Josiah '\n          'Cole, apothecary, John Harrison, surgeon, and Richard Sclater, were '\n          'associated with the medical profession, whilst Fotherley Baker, '\n          'lawyer, John Snee, girdler, and George\\xa0Potter were City '\n          'merchants and businessmen.[^1] At its inception, the Royal London '\n          'Hospital joined the rich thread of charitable infirmaries in the '\n          'capital, including St Thomas’s and Guy’s in Southwark, St '\n          'Bartholomew’s and Bethlehem in the City, and St George’s at Hyde '\n          'Park Corner. Its founders possessed a common concern for the care '\n          'of labourers and merchant seamen, along with their wives and '\n          'children. There was not yet a hospital to serve the east of London '\n          'and its rapidly growing population, mostly dependent on employment '\n          'in industry and trade connected with factories, sugar refineries '\n          'and the port. A fund was raised by donations from noblemen and '\n          'wealthy merchants to establish a new hospital that would offer '\n          'assistance without charge to its patients.[^2] At the first '\n          'official meeting of the founders, Harrison presented a five-year '\n          'lease of a house in Featherstone Street, Moorgate, taken for the '\n          'new infirmary. A motion to establish the charity met with unanimous '\n          'approval. No time was wasted in acting upon this resolution and on '\n          '3 November 1740 the new hospital opened its doors to patients as '\n          'the London Infirmary. The charity received patients sent by its '\n          'governors, as well as people who arrived without a recommendation. '\n          'The house contained about thirty beds for inpatients and cases were '\n          'also taken as outpatients. Harrison, Cole and Dr John Andree, a '\n          'physician who had trained in Rheims, attended on a daily basis '\n          'without pay as surgeon, apothecary and physician. These honorary '\n          'posts were supported by salaried staff, including a matron, a '\n          'porter, nurses and night watches.[^3]</p>\\n'\n          '\\n'\n          '<p>Within six months of its foundation, plans were afoot for the '\n          'infirmary to ‘take a larger house in a more convenient situation’ '\n          'and by April 1741 Harrison had agreed on a house in Prescot Street, '\n          'Goodman’s Fields.[^4] This location was judged to better serve the '\n          'charitable interests of the hospital due to its proximity to the '\n          'dwellings of Spitalfields labourers and merchant sailors near the '\n          'Port of London, and its distance from any other hospital. The house '\n          'was situated on the street’s south side, on a site to the west of '\n          'Magdalen Passage now occupied by the headquarters of the Royal '\n          'College of Psychiatrists. The infirmary moved there the following '\n          'month and opened with room for about forty beds.[^5] A shop was '\n          'also purchased in nearby Alie Street for an apothecary’s store and '\n          'in 1742, another house was taken on Prescot Street to isolate '\n          'patients with venereal disease.[^6]</p>\\n'\n          '\\n'\n          '<h2><em>Need for enlargement</em></h2>\\n'\n          '\\n'\n          '<p>By 1743 the expiration of the Prescot Street lease was looming '\n          'and its renewal under consideration.[^7] Plans for the provision of '\n          'a new building for the hospital were sparked by the intervention of '\n          'Isaac Maddox, Bishop of Worcester, who was invited to deliver a '\n          'sermon at the charity’s annual Anniversary Feast in April 1744. The '\n          'matter of the lease was still unresolved and uncertainty '\n          'surrounding the hospital’s future in Prescot Street might have '\n          'struck a chord with the bishop’s philanthropic interests. From '\n          'modest origins as an orphan, Maddox rose to become a prominent and '\n          'charismatic voice in support of charitable hospitals, including '\n          'Worcester County Infirmary and the St Pancras Smallpox Hospital. He '\n          'is commemorated by a funerary monument in Worcester Cathedral which '\n          'bears a depiction of the Good Samaritan and an epitaph that '\n          'remembers him as ‘Institutor of Infirmaries’.[^8] In his '\n          'Anniversary sermon, the bishop argued that the house at Prescot '\n          'Street was too small, overcrowded and inadequate: ‘admittance is '\n          'impossible; the scanty building waits your necessary assistance to '\n          'enlarge its bounds’.[^9] This declaration spurred the charity into '\n          'action; a donation of twenty pounds from the bishop was allocated '\n          'for the enlargement of the hospital and a fund opened for a new '\n          'building.[^10]</p>\\n'\n          '\\n'\n          '<p>An agreement with Richard Alie, landlord at Prescot Street, '\n          'satisfied the immediate need for enlargement. The Prescot Street '\n          'house was taken on a lease of twenty-one years from Christmas 1744, '\n          'along with three adjoining houses and a shed at the end of the '\n          'garden.[^11] An extensive programme of repairs and improvements '\n          'followed which, by 1747, had reached such an intensity that the '\n          'supervision of a surveyor was required. Isaac Ware was appointed to '\n          'this honorary role in return for compensation of his travel '\n          'expenses.[^12] Ware was in a secure position to perform the duties '\n          'of hospital surveyor, having been the architect of the conversion '\n          'of Lanesborough House at Hyde Park Corner into St George’s '\n          'Hospital.</p>\\n'\n          '\\n'\n          '<p>An inspection of the houses by a committee of governors, '\n          'including surgeon Harrison, initiated plans to repair or rebuild '\n          'the shed in the garden. It became apparent that it was too '\n          'dilapidated for renovation and that a new building was required to '\n          'accommodate a range of functions, including a waiting room, chapel, '\n          'laundry, distillery, laboratory, mortuary and cold bath.[^13] Ware '\n          'was instructed to prepare designs and Joel Johnson and Robert '\n          'Taylor were contracted as builders in partnership.[^14] The '\n          'building was completed in 1747, yet the House Committee was '\n          'troubled by concerns that the cold bath was poorly finished, along '\n          'with complaints from neighbouring residents about a cesspool '\n          'emptying into Chamber Street. By June, Ware judged it ‘impossible’ '\n          'to continue as surveyor due to ‘the distance of his abode, and the '\n          'multiplicity of his other business’ and James Steer was invited to '\n          'take his place.[^15] The committee may have hoped to benefit from '\n          'Steer’s experience as surveyor at Guy’s Hospital, where he designed '\n          'its east wing in 1738–9.[^16] Yet Steer’s involvement was fleeting: '\n          'like his predecessor, he was distracted from his honorary post by '\n          'fee-paying ‘business’. Boulton Mainwaring, surveyor and son of a '\n          'Staffordshire surgeon, was then invited to assess the cold bath and '\n          'sanitary arrangements and by August was acting as surveyor.[^17] '\n          'This was the beginning of a long tenure as Hospital Surveyor; '\n          'Mainwaring was to play a pivotal role in securing the site for a '\n          'new building on Whitechapel Road and designing the hospital’s first '\n          'purpose-built home.</p>\\n'\n          '\\n'\n          '<h2><em>Search for a site</em></h2>\\n'\n          '\\n'\n          '<p>Consideration of the need to secure a permanent home for the '\n          'hospital continued after the building works of 1746–7.[^18] Whilst '\n          'these measures had improved conditions at the infirmary, they did '\n          'not guarantee a long-term solution to the problem of overcrowding. '\n          'The refusal of a lease extension struck a fatal blow to any plans '\n          'to remain at Prescot Street. In June 1746, Richard Leman (formerly '\n          'known as Alie), confined to his country estate with gout, had '\n          'declined to grant an additional term.[^19] This terminal outlook, '\n          'coupled with concern that the houses would be ‘too old and ruinous '\n          'to continue in longer’, prompted the House Committee to revisit the '\n          'Bishop of Worcester’s campaign for a new building and the fund of '\n          '1744. In December 1747 a sub-committee of governors was appointed '\n          'to secure a suitable piece of ground on the east side of London, '\n          'close enough to the City for the convenience of governors, doctors '\n          'and surgeons.[^20]</p>\\n'\n          '\\n'\n          '<p>The sub-committee was ordered to proceed in its search with '\n          '‘great management, secrecy and expedition’.[^21] They had not met '\n          'with any success by April 1748 and the task of finding a site had '\n          'been delegated to Mainwaring. In June, he reported that the only '\n          'suitable site was that ‘commonly known by the Name of White Chappel '\n          'Mount and the Mount Field’.[^22] Situated on the south side of '\n          'Whitechapel Road, an arterial road which offered a direct route to '\n          'and from the City, the site was well-positioned to answer the '\n          'charitable aims of the hospital, being near to the workplaces and '\n          'dwellings of its nominal patients and at a distance from any other '\n          'hospital. It was in the possession of Samuel Worrall, most likely '\n          'the local carpenter and builder prominent in development in '\n          'Spitalfields\\xa0between 1720 and 1750, rather than his namesake and '\n          'relative who served as master of the Masons’ Company in 1739.[^23] '\n          'He offered to part with his interest in the land at Whitechapel, '\n          'which he held on a sixty-one year lease from the City, for £750. '\n          'Mainwaring intended offering about £600 and thought a longer term '\n          'could be obtained easily as the City held the land from the '\n          'Wentworth Estate for a term of 500 years. Worrall insisted that his '\n          'high price would only cover the expense of some new buildings on '\n          'the land. Rocque’s map indicates the presence of buildings '\n          'immediately west of the Mount.[^24]</p>\\n'\n          '\\n'\n          '<p>The hospital began negotiations with Worrall, specifying an '\n          'interest in the undeveloped land.[^25] In October 1748, newspaper '\n          'reports stated that the hospital had taken a piece of ground and '\n          'was proceeding to erect a building, when the matter was actually '\n          'far from settled. The hospital was still embroiled in negotiations '\n          'with Worrall, whose asking price was unreasonably high, and '\n          'considering other properties.[^26] These included sites in lower '\n          'East Smithfield, Leadenhall Street, Houndsditch and Bethnal Green, '\n          'along with the adaptation of London House in Aldersgate Street. '\n          'Greater consideration was given to two other sites in Whitechapel, '\n          'yet one proved too expensive and the other objectionably close to a '\n          'white-lead works.[^27] In August 1749, the situation was still '\n          'uncertain and Worrall now offered his land for the higher price of '\n          '£800, which was received as ‘very improper’. William Myre, a '\n          'governor and merchant, was asked to make an appeal to his '\n          'acquaintance Lucy Alie for the hospital to purchase the freehold of '\n          'its premises at Prescot Street.[^28] This tactical change may be '\n          'ascribed to a hope that their new landlady, who had recently '\n          'inherited Leman’s estate, might be more amenable. Yet this scheme '\n          'led nowhere and by October the committee had returned to Worrall, '\n          'who now offered a £40 deduction and asked for his son to be made a '\n          'life governor of the charity to compensate for his expenditure on '\n          'improving the land. In December the hospital reached an agreement '\n          'with Worrall to purchase the land for £800, with the condition that '\n          'the City would grant the hospital its long-term copyhold.[^29]</p>\\n'\n          '\\n'\n          '<p>Negotiations with the City Lands Committee for its 500-year '\n          'lease from the Wentworth Estate were no less intricate. As the '\n          'hospital was not an incorporated body, the City could not make an '\n          'agreement with the charity but was prepared to make a deal with six '\n          'or more gentlemen acting on its behalf. The City also indicated '\n          'that it was only willing to part with the field lying east of '\n          'Whitechapel Mount. Richard Coope, George Garrett, Richard Sclater, '\n          'Boulton Mainwaring and Dr James Hibbins offered to act on behalf of '\n          'the hospital and by July 1750, had agreed with the City to acquire '\n          'its interest in the Mount Field for the remainder of its 500-year '\n          'lease.[^30]</p>\\n'\n          '\\n'\n          \"<h2><em>Mainwaring's design</em></h2>\\n\"\n          '\\n'\n          '<p>In May 1751, the charity’s building committee instructed '\n          'Mainwaring to prepare a plan for a building to accommodate two '\n          'hundred patients, with provision for future enlargement.[^31] He '\n          'presented five plans to the building committee, of which two (Nos 2 '\n          'and 3) were selected for further consideration. No drawings of the '\n          'five designs survive but the minute books record that one of the '\n          'selected plans was designed to accommodate 198 patients in each '\n          'wing with a total capacity of 396, whereas the other would '\n          'accommodate 366 patients. Mainwaring was instructed to seek advice '\n          'from the hospital’s physicians and surgeons, particularly in '\n          'relation to room height, and to prepare estimates.[^32] The '\n          'committee decided that the projected expense of both plans was '\n          'excessive and that a smaller building ‘might be sufficient for the '\n          'present’. Mainwaring was asked to draw up a new plan ‘as near as he '\n          'could’ to Plan No. 2 for a hospital for 300 patients that could be '\n          'extended as required in the future, along with estimates for the '\n          'building with, and without, ornament. Revised designs (Nos 6 and 7) '\n          'for a building for 312 patients were presented to the committee in '\n          'September and ‘plan and elevation number six without the ornaments’ '\n          'approved.[^33]</p>\\n'\n          '\\n'\n          '<p>The chosen design was for a hospital composed of three detached '\n          'ranges linked by colonnades. No drawings of this early plan survive '\n          'but a scant description of its basic form recalls Wren’s unexecuted '\n          'designs for Greenwich Hospital of 1694–1700 and also Gibbs’s plan '\n          'of <em>c</em>.1730 for the rebuilding of St Bartholomew’s.[^34] '\n          'Mainwaring might also have borrowed from the Foundling Hospital, '\n          'built between 1742 and 1754 to designs by Theodore Jacobsen. The '\n          'main hospital buildings there were planned as three detached ranges '\n          'linked by short lobbies with semicircular headed arches, enclosing '\n          'three sides of a central courtyard.[^35]</p>\\n'\n          '\\n'\n          '<p>Whatever the projected advantages of the chosen plan, by the '\n          'next month it had been reconsidered ‘under the several heads of '\n          'accommodation, convenience, durableness, and expense’, and declared '\n          '‘capable of great improvements’. \\xa0Mainwaring, whose efforts had '\n          'moved to examining the site in preparation for foundations, '\n          'prepared a new design (Plan No. 8) for a single building with '\n          'attached wings.[^36] This was considered superior on each of the '\n          'four points. Firstly, it would accommodate 350 patients. Secondly, '\n          'its arrangement was judged to be more convenient for patients and '\n          'staff, with south-facing wards (deemed the preferable aspect for '\n          'patients) and protection from weather conditions and dust from '\n          'Whitechapel Road. Thirdly, the committee argued that a continuous '\n          'building would be ‘in its nature stronger and more lasting, than '\n          'the same quantity divided into three’. Finally, the new plan was '\n          'less costly as it was for a smaller building and saved the expense '\n          'of colonnades. In another economising measure, plans for a chapel '\n          'were omitted and services to be held in the court room. It was also '\n          'decided that the hospital should be positioned parallel to '\n          'Whitechapel Road and set back by seventy feet or more for the '\n          'governors’ coaches. In December, Plan No. 8 was approved by a '\n          'General Quarterly Court and Mainwaring appointed as surveyor for '\n          'the proposed building.[^37]</p>\\n'\n          '\\n'\n          '<p>The final plan was publicised by an engraving produced by John '\n          'Tinney of Fleet Street, commissioned to be executed with ‘all '\n          'expedition’. Three hundred copies were circulated to the charity’s '\n          'governors to generate donations to the building fund, yet also to '\n          'reassure benefactors that there was ‘nothing ostentatious, '\n          'sumptuous or unnecessary intended’ in its design.[^38] Mainwaring’s '\n          'final design for the new hospital reflects this concern with '\n          'avoiding accusations of extravagance. The north front of the '\n          'hospital facing Whitechapel Road was to have a plain, symmetrical '\n          'façade of twenty-three bays with a projecting centre capped by a '\n          'pediment. With ornament on the exterior restricted to a central '\n          'Doric entrance porch, a dentil cornice and stone doorcases at the '\n          'side entrances, the main elevation was modest yet dignified in '\n          'character. Tinney’s famous engraving also presented plans for the '\n          'ground and first floors of the new building. It\\xa0had a U-shaped '\n          'plan composed of a central three-storey block with two rear wings, '\n          'east and west. The main block contained an axial central corridor '\n          'and two large wards positioned on the south side of each floor. The '\n          'wards were serviced by lobbies containing sinks, privies and '\n          'nurses’ rooms. On the ground floor, the north side of the central '\n          'block was occupied by offices for the apothecary, physicians, '\n          'nurses and stewards. The first floor boasted a large court room at '\n          'its centre, flanked by offices for the surgeon, matron and '\n          'secretary. The rear wings, identical in plan, contained '\n          'back-to-back wards separated by spine walls with central '\n          'fireplaces; an arrangement similar to the ward blocks at St '\n          'Bartholomew’s.</p>\\n'\n          '\\n'\n          '<h2><em>Construction, 1752–78</em></h2>\\n'\n          '\\n'\n          '<p>The new building in Whitechapel Road was constructed to '\n          'Mainwaring’s plain and practical design between 1752 and 1778. The '\n          'central block was built first and completed in 1759 under his '\n          'supervision. The east wing was built in 1771–4 and the west wing in '\n          '1773–8, both under the supervision of Edward Hawkins, who succeeded '\n          'Mainwaring as hospital surveyor in 1771.</p>\\n'\n          '\\n'\n          '<p><strong>Central block, 1752–9</strong></p>\\n'\n          '\\n'\n          '<p>Once plans for the new building were settled in December 1751, '\n          'Mainwaring’s efforts turned to its construction. The following '\n          'spring, John Mann, carpenter, and Thomas Andrews, bricklayer, were '\n          'contracted to build up to first-floor level, and on 11 June 1752, '\n          'the foundation stone was laid in a ceremony attended by noble '\n          'patrons and dignitaries.[^39] Progress was swift, yet it seems that '\n          'the building committee felt that it would be too risky to attempt '\n          'the entire building in a single burst of construction. When the '\n          'workmen completed their contracts in December, Mainwaring was asked '\n          'to prepare separate estimates for finishing the central block and '\n          'its wings. In February 1753, new contracts were advertised for '\n          'completing only the central block. Yet before any were agreed, '\n          'Mainwaring’s report on the cost of finishing the central block '\n          'delivered a blow to the building committee. His\\xa0estimate of '\n          '£5,300 was far higher than the sum of cash held in the building '\n          'fund and annuities held in the name of trustees, leaving a '\n          'shortfall of over £1,150.[^40]</p>\\n'\n          '\\n'\n          '<p>Despite the shortage of funds, building works stumbled along. In '\n          'April and May, Edward Gray was hired as bricklayer, Joseph Clark as '\n          'carpenter and Sanders Oliver as mason and progress remained steady, '\n          'suffering only occasional setbacks. The only serious and recurring '\n          'obstacle was cash flow. Mainwaring increased his estimate for the '\n          'central block to £5,700, and though it was covered in by the end of '\n          'March 1754, work then came to a halt due to a desperate lack of '\n          'funds.[^41]</p>\\n'\n          '\\n'\n          '<p>The suspension of building activity at Whitechapel Road '\n          'coincided with worsening conditions at Prescot Street. In May, '\n          'governors convened to consider the situation and emphasized the '\n          'importance of finishing the new building. A voluntary subscription '\n          'was launched to raise funds and in August, the building committee '\n          '‘readily agreed’ to an offer from several governors to lay one of '\n          'the floors at their own expense.[^42] Donations trickled into the '\n          'building fund and work resumed in 1755, when workmen were employed '\n          'to finish the new building. Gray continued as bricklayer, Oliver as '\n          'mason and Joel Johnson was appointed as carpenter and joiner, '\n          'despite the debacle over shoddy workmanship on the cold bath at '\n          'Prescot Street. Building works now progressed steadily without any '\n          'serious hiccups and, though they continued until 1759, the hospital '\n          'moved into its new building in Autumn 1757.[^43] The lease of the '\n          'infirmary’s houses on Prescot Street was relinquished immediately. '\n          'The allocation of rooms in the completed range did not differ from '\n          'Mainwaring’s final design and, in their decoration, the rooms were '\n          'as unadorned as the exterior.\\xa0The cellar storey comprised a long '\n          'passage providing access to stores, laundries and wash-houses paved '\n          'with Purbeck stone. The south-facing wards of the central block had '\n          'large stone chimneypieces and were furnished with plain wooden '\n          'bedsteads. A handful of rooms, including the General Court Room, '\n          'Committee Room and offices for the physician, surgeon and '\n          'apothecary were afforded the luxury of wainscoting to a height of '\n          'five feet. The surgery, a bleeding room and a cold bath were '\n          'positioned on the ground floor, and the operating theatre in the '\n          'attic. The central block successfully brought together all of the '\n          'hospital’s activities under a single roof, with room at first for '\n          '130 patients. The number of beds increased in the following years '\n          'and by 1765, there were 190.[^44]</p>\\n'\n          '\\n'\n          '<p><strong>East wing and west wing, 1771–8</strong></p>\\n'\n          '\\n'\n          '<p>After the completion of the central block, plans to add the '\n          'proposed side wings rested until 1770. The revival of building '\n          'activity coincided with improved finances, bolstered by a legacy '\n          'from Anne Crayle, a spinster landowner who bequeathed much of her '\n          'wealth to the capital’s voluntary hospitals. Despite this '\n          'significant boon to its efforts, the newly reinstated building '\n          'committee proceeded cautiously: at first Mainwaring was asked to '\n          'prepare a plan and estimate only for a single wing, to be erected '\n          'on the foundations already laid.[^45] His plan for the east wing '\n          'conformed to the original design for identical three-storey wings '\n          'of six bays, with paired wards on each floor and a basement level. '\n          'In 1771, Thomas Langley was appointed as carpenter, Thomas Barnes '\n          'as bricklayer and Isaac Ashton as mason.[^46] As work on the east '\n          'wing commenced, Mainwaring warned that he was struggling to perform '\n          'his duties, particularly ‘the constant attendance upon the workmen '\n          'requisite’, due to the distance from his home. He recommended that '\n          'Edward Hawkins, a local developer on the Leman Estate in Goodman’s '\n          'Fields, should act as surveyor in his absence, yet promised to '\n          'attend as frequently as possible. However, poor health intervened '\n          'and at the end of the year, at the age of sixty-nine, Mainwaring '\n          'resigned.[^47]</p>\\n'\n          '\\n'\n          '<p>Under Hawkins the building works progressed steadily. In 1772, '\n          'contracts were agreed to finish the east wing and by the following '\n          'spring, its completion was in sight as advertisements were '\n          'circulated for a contractor to furnish it with ninety beds.[^48] At '\n          'this point, there was enough optimism for the hospital to assemble '\n          'a building committee to manage the construction of the west wing, '\n          'which took place in 1774–8 and included many of the same '\n          'workmen.[^49] This ambitious strategy soon faltered under financial '\n          'pressure. In 1774, an appeal for donations revealed that the '\n          'completion of the east wing and shell of the west wing had depleted '\n          'the building fund, leaving a shortfall of cash to pay the workmen '\n          'and a deficiency of almost £900 to finish the building. Despite '\n          'these financial straits, work trundled forward. The plea for '\n          'support was successful and in the following year, the building '\n          'committee reported that its fund contained over £1,000 for '\n          'finishing the west wing. This news prompted a flurry of activity '\n          'and by December 1777, the west wing was largely finished.[^50]</p>\\n'\n          '\\n'\n          '<p>The completion of the west wing in 1778 signified the '\n          'realisation of Mainwaring’s design for the first purpose-built home '\n          'for the charity, over thirty-eight years after its foundation.\\xa0'\n          'At this point in its history, Mainwaring’s building overlooked '\n          'Whitechapel Road from its position east of the Mount and was '\n          'bounded by open fields to the south. By the mid-1780s, a narrow '\n          'range had been added at the west end of the hospital parallel to '\n          'the road to provide coach houses and a mortuary. Improvements were '\n          'also made to the hospital’s immediate surroundings: a patients’ '\n          'garden was nestled between the ward wings and a kitchen garden '\n          'cultivated from waste ground at the west.[^51] The charity, by now '\n          'known as the London Hospital, released pamphlets which boasted of '\n          'its convenient location close to the shipping activities of the '\n          'port and Spitalfields, a nucleus for manufacturing, as well as the '\n          'health benefits of its ‘airy situation’. With eighteen wards fitted '\n          'up with about 215 beds, the new building offered a permanent base '\n          'from which the charity could intensify its work. By 1786, the '\n          'charity had treated nearly 450,000 patients since its modest '\n          'beginnings and cemented its status as an institution of critical '\n          'value to impoverished working families in the east of '\n          'London.[^52]</p>\\n'\n          '\\n'\n          '<p>[^1]: <a href=\"http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/\">The National '\n          'Archives</a> (TNA), PROB 11/808/506; TNA PROB 11/884/265; A.E.

Young '\n          'oversaw the addition of a presbytery to the south-east in 1877, a '\n          'school in 1879, and, through Father Henry Volk with justification '\n          'on grounds of a growing immigrant congregation, eastwards extension '\n          'of the church with an apse and enhanced interior decoration in '\n          '1882. Stained-glass windows and wooden Stations of the Cross were '\n          'of German origin.[^1] There were further works in 1885, when bells '\n          'made in Whitechapel were added to the tower. In 1897 Father Joseph '\n          'Verres gained approval for the formation of a covered playground '\n          'below a schoolroom and sanitary block to the north-east. More '\n          'improvements and an extension of this block followed in 1907–8 and '\n          '1912–13.[^2]</p>\\n'\n          '\\n'\n          '<p>Dispersal and expulsion of members of the congregation aside, '\n          'the German church suffered heavily the consequences of wars with '\n          'Germany. It was slightly damaged in a Zeppelin raid in 1917. Having '\n          'been confiscated as enemy property, ownership passed in 1919 to the '\n          'Catholic Archdiocese of Westminster. Consecration followed in 1925 '\n          'when Father Joseph Simml was installed as priest. Then the church '\n          'was entirely destroyed in September 1940 by a high-explosive bomb. '\n          'Simml, an opponent of Fascism, stayed through the war, sometimes '\n          'preaching in the open air.

'\n          'Some prisoners of war also stayed on. War-damage assessment was '\n          'handled for the Archdiocese by Plaskett Marshall &amp; Son, '\n          'architects, who prepared a first conservatively historicist scheme '\n          'for a new church in 1947. Without funding this was premature, but '\n          'on archdiocesan advice the firm was kept on.

Alongside war-damage compensation '\n          'there was to be financial help from the West German government. The '\n          'first plans for the new building disappointed Leushacke so in 1954 '\n          'he involved a German architect and friend, Toni Hermanns of Cleves '\n          '(Leushacke’s birthplace). Hermanns visited the site, prepared '\n          'numerous possibilities in sketches and then presented worked-up '\n          'plans and a model that were photographed and published. The model '\n          'and preliminary sketches survive at the church. Hermanns, a '\n          'powerfully imaginative architect best known for the '\n          'Liebfrauenkirche in Duisburg of 1958–60, proposed a cuboid block, '\n          'to be lit by numerous small round windows in a radiating pattern on '\n          'its long west (liturgical south) elevation. The Archdiocese vetoed '\n          'the scheme \\xad– Leushacke quoted its response as ‘Never!’, upon '\n          'which Plaskett Marshall said (an assertion that he was to remain in '\n          'control in Leushacke’s view), ‘And now you leave the dirty work to '\n          'me!’[^4]\\xa0Plaskett Marshall worked up revised plans in close if '\n          'fraught consultation with Leushacke in 1955–6, encountering many '\n          'more objections from Bishop George Craven at Westminster. The '\n          'scheme was settled with approval from the newly installed '\n          'Archbishop William Godfrey in 1957 after debate over the cubic or '\n          'auditory nature of the main space, progressively non-processional '\n          'for a Catholic congregation at this date. Higgs &amp; Hill Ltd '\n          'undertook construction beginning in November 1959 and the new '\n          'Church of St Boniface opened in November 1960, Cardinal Godfrey '\n          'being present at both the start of work and the opening. A building '\n          'of some architectural panache, the Church of St Boniface is unlike '\n          'other work by Plaskett Marshall and does seem in significant '\n          'measure to reflect Hermann’s approach and aesthetic, though '\n          'Hermanns was not involved after 1954.

This Jewish '\n          'congregation, one of London’s oldest, moved from the City of London '\n          'under Chief Rabbi Dr Hermann Adler (1839–1911), the son of and '\n          'successor to Chief Rabbi Nathan Marcus Adler, founder of the United '\n          'Synagogue. Lewis Solomon was the architect of a substantial and '\n          'outwardly four-square Italianate building, with two entrances for '\n          'men and one for women facing Union Street. The uppermost storey '\n          'housed a committee room and caretaker’s flat. The interior seated '\n          '370 and had an unusual arrangement, with flights of stairs rising '\n          'either side of the Bimah to reach the gallery at the Ark or east '\n          'end for overflow male seating. The ladies gallery was to the '\n          'west.[^9]\\xa0</p>\\n'\n          '\\n'\n          '<p>The street was renamed Adler Street in 1913 and the property '\n          'extended round to Mulberry Street for a Jewish Court to the '\n          'south.\\xa0The district had become predominantly Jewish, with some '\n          'Germans still present. Booth’s survey noted tailors and bootmakers '\n          'as prevalent in 1898, registering general good repair and ‘the '\n          'constant whirr of the sewing machine or tap of the hammer as you '\n          'pass through the streets’, as well as ‘the feeling as of being in a '\n          'foreign town’.[^10]\\xa0By the 1930s many of Mulberry Street’s '\n          'houses were being condemned as dangerous structures and the '\n          'synagogue closed in 1936.

This, which came '\n          'to be called Adler House, was a neat three-storey polychrome-brick '\n          'building with a Star of David between the upper storeys on a '\n          'setback at the site’s corner. Its upper floor had a meeting room '\n          'and a billiard room. Around 1931 it became the Regina Ballrooms and '\n          'a boxing licence was approved in 1934.[^12]</p>\\n'\n          '\\n'\n          '<p>Heavy bomb damage in the Second World War led to the clearance '\n          'of almost everything east of Mulberry Street, all but three houses '\n          'on Plumber’s Row, and five houses and the Mulberry Tree pub on '\n          'Mulberry Street. Plumber’s Row was entirely cleared and widened in '\n          '1962. The synagogue survived into the 1950s for use by the '\n          'displaced Court and as a Jewish Reading Room, which transferred '\n          'into Adler House. That had seen temporary war-time use as a '\n          'synagogue and The Folkhouse (Beth-Am), then briefly in 1946–7 as '\n          'the New Yiddish Theatre, before supporting a further range of '\n          'Jewish community uses. Finally, from 1958 to 1977, synagogue use '\n          'returned for the much-diminished Great Synagogue (Duke’s Place), '\n          'bombed and then sold out of its historic Aldgate home. After a '\n          'short period of commercial use Adler House was demolished around '\n          '1990.[^13]</p>\\n'\n          '\\n'\n          '<p>[^1]: London Metropolitan\\xa0Archives (LMA), O/009/055–6: '\n          'British Library, Crace Port.16.22.</p>\\n'\n          '\\n'\n          '<p>[^2]: LMA, MDR 1787/3/495;

industry in England began in the 1540s when '\n          'Cornelius Bussine, a citizen of Antwerp with knowledge of the '\n          '‘secret’ art of sugar refining, established the first sugarhouse '\n          'within the City of London. Several more followed, but it was not '\n          'until the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries that the business of '\n          'sugar refining truly gathered pace in London. By 1750 there were '\n          'said to be eighty sugarhouses in the capital and a further forty '\n          'dispersed across the rest of England and Scotland. In spite of the '\n          'noxious nature of the industry and the propensity of its buildings '\n          'to catch fire, most of these London refineries were still then '\n          'located within the City walls, close to the Thames or Fleet rivers. '\n          'However, the opening of the West India Docks in 1802 lured the '\n          'sugar trade east and a ruling by the Court of Common Council in '\n          '1807 finally forbade sugarhouses to remain within the City. At the '\n          'close of the eighteenth century suburbs already claimed a number of '\n          'well-established sugarhouses owing to comparative openness and '\n          'access to the Port, but in the early nineteenth century these '\n          'distinctive buildings, and the cramped lodgings of their workers, '\n          'became defining features of the parishes of Whitechapel and St '\n          'George in the East. This shift eastwards coincided with a renewed '\n          'wave of German immigration following that of the eighteenth '\n          'century. Skilled and unskilled sugar workers as well as ambitious '\n          'businessmen arrived from Northern Germany helping to transform the '\n          'industry from a collection of small-scale enterprises, reliant on a '\n          'high degree of manual operations, to a relatively industrialised '\n          'and technologically advanced industry, both dynamic and lucrative '\n          'as a result of the nearly unrivalled British consumer '\n          'market.[^1]</p>\\n'\n          '\\n'\n          '<p>George Martineau, a descendant of one East End family of sugar '\n          'refiners, reflected that “in 1856….practically all the loaf sugar '\n          'consumed in this country was produced in the East End of London.” '\n          'The 1851 census demonstrated that over 90% of those engaged in the '\n          'London sugar-refining trade were resident in the borough of '\n          'Stepney. Whilst the London sugar industry experienced a period of '\n          'particularly profitable expansion in the 1860s and 1870s such '\n          'extravagant prosperity did not last. Whereas 1864 could claim '\n          'twenty-eight London sugarhouses, by 1880 only twelve remained. '\n          'Affected by duties, the rise of beet sugar and proximity to '\n          'Continental competition, the East End industry slumped, giving way '\n          'to Liverpool and Greenock, which were better placed for Caribbean '\n          'imports once London’s monopolies were loosened, before nationally '\n          'subsiding not long after. Building new refineries on the banks of '\n          'the Thames in the 1870s, Tate and Lyle of Silvertown are the sole '\n          'survivors of this East End industry, having cannily diversified '\n          'into syrup and been early backers of the newly invented sugar cube. '\n          'A single functioning sugarhouse lasted into the twentieth century '\n          'in Whitechapel. Belonging to the Martineau family and located on '\n          'Kingward Street, the Company secured a joint license with Tate and '\n          'Lyle of the Langen cube-making process in the late nineteenth '\n          'century and this delayed their demise but could not halt it '\n          'altogether.

Owning a number of Whitechapel refineries after '\n          'their forced relocation outside the City walls in 1800, the '\n          'business was divided between two Norwich-born brothers, David '\n          '(1754-1840) and Peter (1755-1847). David developed a group of '\n          'sugarhouses at the south end of Christian Street. Peter, on the '\n          'other hand, established himself in the north-west of the parish in '\n          'airy Goulston Square.</p>\\n'\n          '\\n'\n          '<p>In 1775 John Fry, a merchant of Finsbury, was owner of a '\n          'warehouse in the south-eastern corner of Goulston Square, formerly '\n          'Cowley’s Snuff House. Significantly however, by 1806 he was also in '\n          'possession of an apparently substantial sugarhouse located on the '\n          'north side of present-day New Goulston Street. This was a '\n          'commercial partnership with William Osborne, who had previously '\n          'refined sugar on the site with James Diass in 1801. The business '\n          'failed however and Fry was declared bankrupt in 1806; his assets, '\n          'including the sugarhouse and its contents, were auctioned off. The '\n          'seized sugarhouse was awaiting a new owner when a case against a '\n          'theft of a loaf of sugar by a sugarbaker was heard at the Old '\n          'Bailey. Involving three sugar bakers at the site as well as the '\n          'clerk of the sugarhouse, John Bell, the incident confirmed that the '\n          'refinery was gated and possessed a ‘men’s room’ – a lodging house '\n          'for single male workers. The demise of Fry’s business dovetailed '\n          'with the Martineau’s arrival into Whitechapel from the City. Two '\n          'confiscated sites, a warehouse at nos 3-5 Goulston Street and the '\n          'sugarhouse on New Goulston Street, were transferred to Peter '\n          'Martineau who was quick to recognise the potential for further '\n          'development at the northern site. Sometime between 1813 and 1818, '\n          'Martineau constructed a brick dwelling house, counting house, new '\n          'men’s room and scum house (used for producing lower grade sugar '\n          'by-products) facing onto both New Goulston Street and Goulston '\n          'Street. This new accommodation was located to the east of the main '\n          'sugarhouse and divided from it by a gated yard. Given the flammable '\n          'nature of the sugar and also the intense heat necessary for the '\n          'production of it, separation of the most dangerous processes from '\n          'on-site housing was typical. In 1817, Peter Martineau &amp; Sons '\n          '‘of Goulston Street’ insured stock, utensils and the brick sugar '\n          'house for £19 000 spread across five insurance companies (Sun, '\n          'Eagle, Atlas, Glove, Union). The additional new buildings and their '\n          'contents were insured with the Sun for £3000 one year later. This '\n          'was comparable to the seven-storey premises of Severn, King and Co '\n          'at Commercial Road, insured for £15 000 in 1819.[^3]</p>\\n'\n          '\\n'\n          '<p><img alt=\"\" '\n          'src=\"/media/uploads/2017/03/10/sewers_sugar.JPG\"></p>\\n'\n          '\\n'\n          '<p><em>Metropolitan Sewers Plan of Goulston Street and '\n          'Neighbourhood, Whitechapel, 1849 (LMA,\\xa0SC/PM/ST/01/002).

In 1825 it was reported that a fire destroyed nearly half '\n          'of the main sugarhouse building, but that the speedy arrival of '\n          'three fire engines, arriving from the three different insurers, '\n          'curtailed the blaze with a plentiful supply of water. In 1847 a new '\n          'phase of building work was undertaken by George Webb of Gowers Walk '\n          'and modern refining pans were set in place by him later in 1855. '\n          'Webb was also implicated in the construction of other local '\n          'sugarhouses around this period: Elers and Morgan’s at Goodman’s '\n          'Stile (1849), and Davies’ at Osborne Street (1855) and Rupert '\n          'Street (1854).

Supplying fruit trees as well as '\n          'ornamental plants, Gurle’s ‘great garden’ was London’s largest '\n          'nursery in the 1660s and 70s, and continued after Gurle became the '\n          'king’s gardener at St James’s Palace in 1677. It included 299 '\n          'asparagus beds, 11,600 plum, cherry and pear stocks and 127 '\n          'mulberry trees. In 1719 it was still in the occupancy of a Martin '\n          'Girle, a son or grandson, though the twelve acres had been leased '\n          'in 1717 to John Ward and William Mason. By 1680 Brick Lane was '\n          'solidly built up with Montague (later Manby) Court off the north '\n          'side of the west end of Mountague Street, close to where Frostic '\n          'Place succeeded.

Running east from the top end, Mason’s Court, after William '\n          'Mason, was a superior development of around\\xa01720, eleven '\n          'good-sized three-storey houses, many of them double fronted and '\n          'five bays wide.

In its early days as Mason’s Court a number of the '\n          'occupants had French surnames, presumably of Huguenot origin, and '\n          'the silk industry was an important presence, spilling over as '\n          'growth out from Spitalfields. Along the north side, a weaver, '\n          'Abraham Fleury, had No. 2 by 1740, and Samuel Bradford and John '\n          'Ireland, silk dressers, were at No. 3 around 1790–1800. Among silk '\n          'throwsters were James Plantier then Peter Merzeau, who had No. 5, '\n          'with a workshop, in succession through the second half of the '\n          'eighteenth century. At No. 2 in the 1820s was William Ayres, a '\n          'carpenter, his wife being a tambour maker. Poverty crept in.

Two '\n          'years later cholera deaths in the area were attributed to '\n          'overcrowding, particularly among Jewish immigrants, and in 1872 a '\n          'house further east in Chicksand Street was declared wholly unfit '\n          'for habitation after the death of a cellar-dweller.[^4]</p>\\n'\n          '\\n'\n          '<p>Two of the Mason’s Court houses (originally Nos 6 and 7 at the '\n          'east end of the south side) survived into the 1960s as 8–12 '\n          'Chicksand Street. These were for many years the front premises of '\n          'Robert Womersley &amp; Son, drysalters (dealers in chemical '\n          'products).

Factory premises on the north side of '\n          'Chicksand Street east of Osborn Place were Francis George March '\n          'Desanges’s silk-dying works from the late 1830s, a successor to Sir '\n          'Francis Desanges’s Wheler Street premises. By 1850 they had been '\n          'divided also to accommodate Henry Cox, a manufacturing chemist, and '\n          'J. H. Heckman, a skinner and furrier. East of these works, Abraham '\n          'Davis built Helena Terrace, four pairs of back-to-back tenements, '\n          'in 1889–91.[^7]</p>\\n'\n          '\\n'\n          '<p>As further south, this whole area became poorer and '\n          'predominantly Jewish by the 1890s.

Booth’s survey, coming here from '\n          'Spitalfields, noted ‘how the height of the houses gradually '\n          'increases as Whitechapel is approached’, and the ‘tendency in '\n          'Jewish districts to increase the accommodation both extensively by '\n          'occupying other streets and intensively by building higher houses.’ '\n          '[^8] As if on cue, in 1898–9 the east side of Frostic Place, said '\n          'to be all brothels over shops, was rebuilt by D. and M.

J. Leonard Williams was '\n          'the architect. This was adapted for occasional use as the ‘People’s '\n          'Market Cinema’ in 1909–10. There was other development by some '\n          'among Davis’s brothers to the east on this block in the same '\n          'period. In 1927 the market was reappropriated to be a Poultry '\n          'Shechita, or kosher slaughtering yard, a business that dominated '\n          'both sides of Hope (from 1938 Monthorpe) Street into the post-war '\n          'period, and drew curious children as spectators. Further west there '\n          'were miscellaneous factories behind tenements on Finch Street.

Daniel Mathias, Whitechapel’s Rector since 1807, '\n          'headed this initiative towards educating more of Whitechapel’s poor '\n          'children. A survey of the parish had uncovered 5,161 children under '\n          'the age of seven and 3,204 above that age. Of the latter, 991 '\n          'attended the thirty-two schools already in the parish, leaving '\n          '2,213 uneducated. Few parents attended church, providing an '\n          'additional motive for the evangelical Society. A scheme coalesced '\n          'for the establishment of a new school with a hall large enough for '\n          '1,000 to be taught on Bell’s (National Society) principles; it '\n          'would also be used for religious service on Sundays. The first '\n          'thought was to procure an adaptable building, but by early 1813 '\n          'there were plans to build on land to the north of the 1680s school '\n          'and a lease (from John Wildman) was agreed. In the event the '\n          'Society decided to use this land to extend the parish’s burial '\n          'ground eastwards and to build the school on the west part of the '\n          'burial ground of the 1790s to face what had been made St Mary '\n          'Street. The Vestry gave up the land and the Bishop of London '\n          'approved the project in the summer of 1813. However, funds were '\n          'wanting; despite a grant of £300 from the National Society, the '\n          'building fund was more than £1000 short of its target of £2500. The '\n          'Duke of Cambridge laid a foundation stone on 12 October 1813 in an '\n          'opulent ceremony said to have been attended by thousands that '\n          'brought in £677 11 6 in donations. Completed in 1815, the building '\n          'was among the earliest purpose-built National schools. It was also, '\n          'as Nikolaus Pevsner had it in an unconscious recognition of the '\n          'intended secondary use, ‘like a chapel’.[^1]</p>\\n'\n          '\\n'\n          '<p>Its architect remains unknown, though for circumstantial reasons '\n          'Samuel Page is a candidate (see the entry on the rebuilding of the '\n          'Davenant School). It was a single-storey stock-brick barn of about '\n          '80ft by 120ft. Its round-headed window openings, some very tall, '\n          'had cast-iron Gothic tracery. There were porches at both ends and a '\n          'western clock turret. The main square room to the west was for the '\n          'teaching of 600 boys, with a half-sized room beyond for 400 girls, '\n          'all convertible into a single space. Two rows of square timber '\n          'posts helped support a vast queen-post truss timber roof. There was '\n          'a hot-air heating system, devised and paid for by Davis with John '\n          'Craven, another Goodman’s Fields sugar-baker. Tom Flood Cutbush '\n          '(the son-in-law of Luke Flood, Treasurer to the Davenant School) '\n          'procured an organ, which he played himself, also arranging '\n          'performances of oratorios in the 1820s.</p>\\n'\n          '\\n'\n          '<p>In 1844–5 the Rev. William Weldon Champneys oversaw '\n          'reconfiguration of the east end, the girls’ room reduced, raised '\n          'and given a railed balcony to create space below for an infants’ '\n          'school, with living rooms for the master and mistress. Other '\n          'subdivision for classrooms in the western corners followed in '\n          '1868–9 with G. H. Simmonds as architect. The west porch was lost '\n          'when St Mary Street was widened in 1881–2. George Lansbury, an '\n          'alumnus around 1870, recalled ‘what a school-building! No '\n          'classrooms, one huge room with classes in each corner and one in '\n          'the middle.’ [^2] The east part of the burial ground, disused from '\n          '1853, was taken for a playground from 1862. This was shared with '\n          'the Davenant School and a disinfecting house was inserted in its '\n          'north-east corner in 1871. The National School was also known as '\n          'the Whitechapel Society’s School, St Mary’s School or St Mary '\n          'Street School. In 1874, 360 children were presented for '\n          'examinations, a decade later 443. It had less cachet than the '\n          'Davenant School, which, to Lansbury, was for ‘“charity sprats” – '\n          'girls and boys dressed in ridiculous uniforms’.[^3]\\xa0 After '\n          'administrative changes (see below) there were adaptations in '\n          '1889–90, including the addition of a caretaker’s house to the '\n          'north. The school continued under LCC maintenance as Davenant '\n          'Elementary Schools, its roll gradually declining from 784 in 1900 '\n          'to 300 in 1938. It closed in 1939. After post-war use as a '\n          'second-hand clothing warehouse and despite calls for its '\n          'preservation, the building was demolished in 1975.[^4]\\xa0</p>\\n'\n          '\\n'\n          '<p>[^1]:\\xa0Nikolaus Pevsner, <em>The Buildings of England: London '\n          'except the Cities of London and Westminster</em>, 1952, p. 426: '\n          'LMA, P93/MRY1/090; E/BN/102; CLC/011/MS11097/1: <em>Annual Report '\n          'of the National Society etc</em>, 1813, pp. 34–5: <em>Gentleman’s '\n          'Magazine</em>, vol. 83, Nov. 1813, pp. 493–4: Reynolds, '\n          'pp.35–43</p>\\n'\n          '\\n'\n          '<p>[^2]: As quoted in Reynolds, p.51</p>\\n'\n          '\\n'\n          '<p>[^3]: As quoted in Reynolds, p.51</p>\\n'\n          '\\n'\n          '<p>[^4]: LMA, A/DAV/001/18: District Surveyors Returns : <em>The '\n          'Builder</em>, 19 Dec 1868, p. 936: Ordnance\\xa0Survey map 1873: '\n          'Metropolitan Board of Works Minutes, 15 Dec 1882, p.922: Tower '\n          'Hamlets\\xa0Local History Library and Archives (hereafter THLHLA), '\n          'LC6865, Annual Report, 1883–4; L/THL/D/1/1/65: <em>Endowed '\n          'Charities (County of London)</em>, 1904, p. 51: London County '\n          'Council Minutes, 29 Jan. 1907, p.111: TNA, ED21/12131; /35337; '\n          '/57367: <em>Eeast London Observer</em>, 27 April 1935: Reynolds, '\n          'pp. 43\\xad–51: Historic England, London Region historians’ files '\n          'TH1 and TH26; photographs 1973 and 1975</p>\\n',\n  'created': '2017-08-24',\n  'feature': {'geometry': {'coordinates': [[[[-0.06408176276412,\n                                              51.518388594133064],\n                                             [-0.064079076989357,\n                                              51.518451921601226],\n                                             [-0.064014118536147,\n                                              51.518467104995885],\n                                             [-0.063936244085074,\n                                              51.51842608315136],\n                                             [-0.06387175509906,\n                                              51.51844488660313],\n                                             [-0.063789009522268,\n                                              51.51833442643744],\n                                             [-0.063997611137361,\n                                              51.51827758805008],\n                                             [-0.06408176276412,\n                                              51.518388594133064]]]],\n                           'type': 'MultiPolygon'},\n              'id': 452,\n              'properties': {'address': 'Davenant Youth Centre, 179 '\n                                        'Whitechapel Road',\n                             'b_name': 'Davenant Youth Centre (former Davenant '\n                                       'School)',\n                             'b_number': '179',\n                             'count': 17,\n                             'feature_type': 'WHITECHAPEL_BUILDING',\n                             'street': 'Whitechapel Road'},\n              'type': 'Feature'},\n  'id': 451,\n  'last_edited': '2018-01-22',\n  'title': 'St Mary Street School'},\n {'author': {'id': 2, 'username': 'surveyoflondon'},\n  'body': '<p>Rebuilding of the original schools of the 1680s by the Charity '\n          'School Trustees followed hard on the heels of the opening of the '\n          'National School. Larger premises were wanted to accommodate 100 '\n          'boys and 100 girls, again for the application of Bell’s system. The '\n          'funding of this project had been given a start by Samuel Hawkins, '\n          'who had donated £600 in 1808 towards the building of a new school, '\n          'and a coachbuilder called Lewis (possibly Thomas Lewis, a '\n          'coach-master of 45 Leman Street), who gave £500 in 1817. Mathias '\n          'was still the Rector and the Treasurer for the trustees was Luke '\n          'Flood (1738–1818), a painter, corn chandler and corrupt magistrate '\n          'and commissioner of sewers who had premises on Whitechapel Road (on '\n          'the site of No. 57). Flood left £1000 to the school when he died in '\n          'February 1818, this the most munificent of the period’s gifts. '\n          'Flood’s son-in-law was the architect Samuel Page who had been '\n          'acting as a surveyor for the parish since at least 1807. Around '\n          '1813 Page was also involved in securing an improved endowment for '\n          'the school. It seems likely that he was charged with designing the '\n          'school building; it is a characteristically sub-Soanian work.

Major Rohde, the Leman Street '\n          'sugar refiner, was also a Trustee. Another was William Davis, who '\n          'succeeded Flood as Treasurer.

It originally had steps up at a central entrance to a '\n          'raised ground floor, with a deeper railed area in front of the '\n          'basement, and a dedicatory stone plaque in a blind arch above the '\n          'entrance. There was a central staircase and a single classroom to '\n          'each side on each of the main storeys. In the 1860s, after '\n          'outbuildings to the west were given up, two blocks were built in '\n          'the yard for boys, the front range being given over to the girls. '\n          'The plaque had been taken down before major changes in the mid '\n          '1890s that were part of a thorough reformation (see the account of '\n          'the Foundation School).

In 1807 Richard Ivory, a brewer and ‘dealer in '\n          'wine and spirituous liquors’ who had occupied the pub and a small '\n          'brewhouse to its rear since at least 1786, launched a call for '\n          'subscribers to join him in setting up the Albion Brewery. He took a '\n          'lease of two acres of open land to the rear of the Drapers’ '\n          'Almshouses on the west side of the line of the watercourse known as '\n          'the Black Ditch, and by 1809 there was a compact new brewhouse '\n          'standing behind a tun room for the brewing of porter, said to be '\n          'capable of producing 10,000 barrels a year. This was a speculation, '\n          'and with access restricted to a narrow passage on the west side of '\n          'the Blind Beggar, it proved difficult to find a taker for a new '\n          '60-year lease. John Hoffman stepped into the breach and ran the '\n          'brewery up to 1818 when he fell bankrupt. His creditors sold the '\n          'brewery in 1819 to Philip Betts Blake and James Mann, of the '\n          'Strandbridge Brewery, Narrow Wall, Lambeth. Mann moved to the site '\n          'and Blake, the senior partner, retired in 1825.[^1]</p>\\n'\n          '\\n'\n          '<p>In 1846 Mann’s son, also James, entered into partnership with '\n          'Robert Crossman, a Berwick-upon-Tweed brewer, who brought in Thomas '\n          'Paulin. Mann was himself soon succeeded by his son – Thomas Mann '\n          '(d.1887), and then grandson, Thomas James Mann (1848–97). The '\n          'partnership prospered, production rising to 133,000 barrels a year. '\n          'Long-term tenure of the site was secured from Ivory’s descendants '\n          'in 1859 and the Drapers’ Almshouses in front were acquired in '\n          '1862–3 and then cleared. This enabled a rebuilding programme that '\n          'was completed in 1868. Oversight has been attributed to E. N. '\n          'Clifton. Part of this was the front offices range of 1863–4 that '\n          'survives to the east of the entrance courtyard. That open space was '\n          'retained in front of the brewhouse, which was rebuilt, repowered, '\n          'refitted and raised in 1866; only vaults from the building of 1808 '\n          'were retained. On the west side of the forecourt there was '\n          'henceforward a three-bay four-storey head-brewer’s house facing '\n          'Whitechapel Road, latterly replaced in pastiche form (No. 331). '\n          'Behind this there was now an extensive range of fermenting vats and '\n          'sugar stores with a rooftop tank. There was still an open yard to '\n          'the rear with a well to the north, 181ft (55.2m) deep and iron '\n          'lined for its upper 15ft (4.6m) at a diameter of 8ft (2.4m). '\n          'Production rose to 220,000 barrels a year.[^2]</p>\\n'\n          '\\n'\n          '<p>As public taste shifted from porter to mild ale, the brewers '\n          'adapted, opening a sister brewery in Burton upon Trent in 1875, and '\n          'shifting\\xa0from vertical storage in vats to horizontal storage in '\n          'barrels laid out at basement and raised-ground level in fireproof '\n          'ale stores on an iron-framed grid on a western part of the yard. '\n          'Robert Spence, the firm’s engineer and architect, was responsible '\n          'for design. A new and larger artesian well was formed in 1878–9 '\n          'immediately behind the brewhouse, 190ft (58m) deep and 9ft (2.7m) '\n          'in diameter with a borehole drilled 410ft (125m) down – this was '\n          'recorded before being filled during recent Crossrail works. '\n          'Acquisition of a\\xa0former floorcloth factory at 329 Whitechapel '\n          'Road in 1882 permitted Spence to extend the ale stores and vaults '\n          'in 1886–8, with John Mowlem &amp; Co. as contractors. Spacious '\n          'stabling had been erected on the east side of Cambridge Heath Road '\n          'in 1885 and a bottling-store complex was built on the south side of '\n          'Whitechapel Road on Raven Row in 1889. The brewery had 360 '\n          'employees and an annual output in excess of 250,000 '\n          'barrels.[^3]</p>\\n'\n          '\\n'\n          '<p>It had been learned that London water was good enough for ales. '\n          'From 1894 to 1900 the Albion Brewery was upgraded yet further as '\n          'one of England’s largest breweries, and the Burton brewery was '\n          'sold. Spence supervised works through the 1890s. A new boiler house '\n          'near Brady Street was supplemented by a 135ft (41m) chimney, and, '\n          'with the introduction of bottled brown ale, the stores and vaults '\n          'were again extended westwards to Brady Street, retaining an open '\n          'yard with a trabeated colonnade to the street. This phase also '\n          'evidently included works of embellishment to the brewhouse façade. '\n          'The brewery was extended northwards across Bath Street in 1901–2, '\n          'from Brady Street to Foster Street (obliterating the south end of '\n          'Pereira Street), for cask-washing premises and, north-east, a tall '\n          'new engine house and chimney, work overseen by William Bradford '\n          '&amp; Sons, architects and brewers’ consulting engineers, with '\n          'Holland &amp; Hannen as builders.

Other additions included a fermenting house of 1902 (by '\n          'Bradford &amp; Sons) and a grains drying house of 1914 (William '\n          'Stewart, architect), both on the south side of Lisbon Street '\n          '(Darling Row).[^4]</p>\\n'\n          '\\n'\n          '<p>In 1958 merger with Watney Combe Reid &amp; Co. created Watney '\n          'Mann, which was acquired by Grand Metropolitan in 1972.

'\n          'German church in Britain. It opened in 1763, and has changed '\n          'remarkably little since. German immigration to London, much of it '\n          'by Protestant refugees fleeing religious persecution, had been '\n          'significant in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. There were '\n          'several German churches in London by 1700, but these have all now '\n          'gone.[^1] Through the first half of the eighteenth century '\n          'membership of London’s German Lutheran churches doubled to about '\n          '4,000. Some of this rise can be attributed to the continuing '\n          'immigration of those seeking religious asylum, and the additional '\n          'impact of the arrival of the Hanoverian Court should not be '\n          'forgotten. However, it was economic migration that was the main '\n          'basis for the establishment of a German settlement in Whitechapel. '\n          'Sugar refining in London had been in German hands from its '\n          'introduction in the mid seventeenth century, expertise in processes '\n          'previously established in the Hanseatic towns being deployed to '\n          'build up a substantial sugar-baking industry in Whitechapel and '\n          'other eastern districts close to the Port of London, into which '\n          'huge quantities of sugar were being imported from the West Indies. '\n          'The immigrant German sugar merchants, craftsmen and workers '\n          'naturally held on to the secrets of their trade, giving it '\n          'continuity and concentration in these east London locales that were '\n          'remote from the existing German churches in the City of London and '\n          'Westminster.

The lease aside, this accounted for virtually '\n          'all the funds that had by then been raised.[^4] Johnson (1720-99) '\n          'was a successful local carpenter who had made himself a contracting '\n          'builder. In 1747 he had worked on a Baptist meeting house further '\n          'west on Alie Street, and in 1754 he built himself a large workshop '\n          'near Whitechapel parish church, the site of which on Whitechapel '\n          'Road is now Altab Ali Park. From 1755-9 Johnson worked under the '\n          'architect Boulton Mainwaring in the building of the London Hospital '\n          'further east along Whitechapel Road. He was also said, in an '\n          'obituary that credited him with ‘many chapels’, to have been the '\n          'architect of the church of St John, Wapping, in 1756, a building '\n          'with striking similarities to St George’s. However, it is possible '\n          'that there too he was working under Mainwaring, who gave evidence '\n          'about the state of the old Wapping church where Johnson did not. '\n          'Indeed, Johnson himself related that he began ‘to strike into the '\n          'business of an architect’ only in 1762. The absence of any record '\n          'of payment to any other surveyor or architect at St George’s leads '\n          'to the surmise that this is what he was doing at Alie Street. It '\n          'cannot, however, be ruled out that Johnson’s firm was working under '\n          'another designer, perhaps Mainwaring again. Johnson’s wife and '\n          'infant son died in 1763-4 and he left the conduct of business to a '\n          'partner, a Mr Langley, ‘troubling myself very little with the '\n          'carpenters’ business’.[^5]</p>\\n'\n          '\\n'\n          '<p>Johnson &amp; Co. were paid another £494 3s in 1764-5, which '\n          'probably related to an early extension of the church and the '\n          'addition of the vestry block. Seams in the brickwork of the east '\n          'and west walls show that the church was initially intended to be '\n          'one bay shorter, and that during construction it was enlarged to '\n          'the north. In keeping with this vaults do not extend under the '\n          'north end of the church. It is also evident that the extension came '\n          'during rather than either before or after the fitting out of the '\n          'interior. Already in May 1763, when the church was consecrated, '\n          'Thomas Johnson was being paid for a marble slab, probably the floor '\n          'of the altar dais that survives, and a mahogany frame to a '\n          'communion table. The box pews, which also survive, were evidently '\n          'in by February 1764 when Errick Kneller was paid for the painting '\n          'on them of 159 numbers. Kneller was also paid for painting two '\n          'boards, presumably those still in place bearing the Ten '\n          'Commandments in German. Others who received payments in 1764 '\n          'included Paul Morthurst, carpenter and joiner, Thomas Palmer, '\n          'plasterer, and Sanders Olliver, mason.[^6] It is notable that all '\n          'these building tradesmen, except perhaps Kneller, appear to have '\n          'been English. In its original architectural forms and '\n          'constructional details, both outside and in, the church is not '\n          'evidently German. The timing of all these payments suggests that '\n          'the main body of the church went up in 1762-3, the north extension '\n          'following in 1763-4, with the two-storey vestry block to the '\n          'north-east being added in 1765-6, all complete by 21 August 1766 '\n          'which date appears on the brick apron to a first-floor window of '\n          'the vestry block.</p>\\n'\n          '\\n'\n          '<p>[^3]: Tower Hamlets Local History Library (hereafter THLHL), '\n          'TH/8662/3, St George’s German Lutheran Church, Financial Summaries '\n          '1763-95, ff 1-2.<br>\\n'\n          '[^4]: Ibid.<br>\\n'\n          '[^5]: Johnson’s manuscript memoirs are held in the London Borough '\n          'of Waltham Forest Archives, Acc. 10199.

The appeal for money was launched '\n          'on 7 June 1855, with the statement that ‘It is a long time since '\n          'any repairs have been done to the building; and in order to put it '\n          'into proper condition, an outlay of £300 or £400 will be '\n          'required.’[^16] The successful fund-raising was broadly based, '\n          'seemingly drawing primarily on Whitechapel’s still strong '\n          'sugar-baking German community. It remained the case that ‘the '\n          'Elders and Wardens of the Church consist almost exclusively of the '\n          'Boilers, Engineers and superior workers in the Sugar '\n          'Refineries.’[^17] Mid nineteenth-century attendances were said to '\n          'be about 400 to 500, of which about 250 paid pew rents. A '\n          'sub-committee of five led by Cappel managed the restoration; three '\n          'of the others – Martin Brünjes, William Prieggen and Claus Bohling '\n          '- were local sugar refiners. The church was closed for the building '\n          'works during July and August 1855. Costs escalated and legal '\n          'difficulties held up renewal of the lease; it was September 1856 '\n          'before the congregation was asked ‘to bear testimony to the present '\n          'condition of the building and the propriety of its '\n          'decoration.’[^18] The works had been supervised by J. Cumber, who '\n          'was also surveyor to the Phoenix Fire Office,[^19] and £540 was '\n          'paid to the builders, William Hill and J. Keddell. In all £771 was '\n          'spent on restoring the church. This included replacement of all the '\n          'original leaded-light windows, and top-to-bottom redecoration, '\n          'including refurbishment of the pews and the marbling of the '\n          'columns.[^20] James Powell &amp; Sons of Whitefriars were paid £53 '\n          'for two stained-glass windows, a Crucifixion that is now in the '\n          'south wall, and an answering Ascension that has been lost. These '\n          'originally flanked the Commandment Boards at the north end of the '\n          'church.[^21]</p>\\n'\n          '\\n'\n          '<p>Given the considerable expense of this restoration it is '\n          'interesting that the interior was not more substantially altered, '\n          'particularly when the generally radical and doctrinaire character '\n          'of mid nineteenth-century English church restorations is recalled. '\n          'Box-pew seating was reviled by the contemporary Anglo-Catholic '\n          'revival. It is important in this context to note that there is no '\n          'reason to suppose ecclesiological influence in a German Lutheran '\n          'church. Indeed, there was no Catholic revival in Lutheranism until '\n          'the early twentieth century, and iconoclastic attitudes persisted '\n          'through the nineteenth century.[^22] Lutheranism aside conservatism '\n          'in church liturgy and architecture is entirely to be expected in an '\n          'enclosed immigrant group like the Whitechapel German community.

Made by E. F. Walcker, '\n          'then of Ludwigsburg, for £353, this organ survives in an enlarged '\n          'form following repairs that included a new console, carried out by '\n          'the same firm in 1937. It was restored by Bishop &amp; Son in '\n          '2003-4. Space for enlargement within its case was gained by moving '\n          'the wooden pedal pipes from inside to against the south-west '\n          'window, and by removing part of the foot-blowing mechanism, of a '\n          'type rare in Britain, the remains of which survive disconnected on '\n          'the east side of the case.

By '\n          'the 1880s the local sugar industry had dwindled from 30 '\n          'establishments to three, and those who could afford to do so moved '\n          'away from Whitechapel, a part of the East End that had become '\n          'notoriously rough. London’s German population as a whole rose from '\n          '16,082 in 1861 to 27,290 in 1911, the East End remaining a focus '\n          'for settlement, if only because most immigrants arrived in the '\n          'docks. Whitechapel’s German community shifted gradually from '\n          'dependence on sugar baking to a range of other and more standard '\n          'trades, becoming known for its butchers, bakers and domestic '\n          'servants. From 1891 to 1914 Pastor Georg Mätzold (1862-1930) '\n          'rebuilt the parish, religion being, as ever, paramount in cultural '\n          'continuity for new immigrants. In the years up to 1914 St George’s '\n          'was said to be the most active German parish in Britain, with '\n          'average congregations of about 130.[^24]</p>\\n'\n          '\\n'\n          '<p>Repairs undertaken in 1910 under the supervision of Frederick '\n          'Rings, another German architect, included the replacement of the '\n          'vestry windows with those now in place.

In 1912 '\n          'there was a fire in the building adjoining to the north. The Powell '\n          'windows were damaged, and the Ascension presumably destroyed.

Situated 400 yards from St Mary's Station, Whitechapel, it stands with its frontage in Fieldgate-st., in the very midst of an enormous population.

So perfect has been the construction of these Rowton Houses that, except in trifling details, it has not been possible to introduce any improvement in the last building. Without a retrogression, the primary conception has been adhered to of giving each man a separate cubicle with a separate window under his control; and such privacy and such a bed that, in the words of Lord Rowton, an Archbishop might sleep there in decency and comfort. All other accommodation - dining-room, smoking-room, reading-room, and bathrooms - is found on the ground floor. In the locker corridors are fitted the wardrobe cupboards, where each man may keep his clothes and possessions under lock and key. Other conveniences include dressing-rooms, barber's shop, and a room each for shoemaker and tailor, where cheap repairs may be carried out, and new or secondhand goods obtained. The finest apartment in this \"Poor Man's Hotel\" is the dining-room, which has table room for 456 men. Here anything may be bought at cost price - from cooked meat at 4d. to a farthing's worth of milk or sugar. There are also provided all necessary cooking utensils for the gratuitous use of lodgers desirous of catering for themselves.'[^1]</p>\n\n<p>Rowton House, Whitechapel, opened in August 1902.

            "text/plain": "'Medieval churchesThe first church on the site that is now Altab Ali Park was built in the mid thirteenth century (by 1282), dedicated to Mary and from the outset identified as ‘de Matefelun’. This, which became Matfelon, may derive from a family name; Richard Matefelun, a wine merchant, is said to have been present in the area in 1230. If this is the derivation (matfelon as meaning knapweed is the least preposterous of numerous suggested alternatives), it was presumably in recognition of a pious benefaction, whether prompted by local need or not. It does seem clear that there would have been significant population growth in the area, and that the existing parish church of St Dunstan, Stepney, aside from being distant had been outgrown. Parish status was granted by 1320, the vicarage being in the gift of the Rector of Stepney. [^1]Archaeological evidence indicates that the church, always aligned to the adjacent road and not properly oriented,\\xa0was of clunch or white chalk rubble. It thus, no doubt, came to be known as the ‘white chapel’, an appellation in use by 1344. Clunch was not uncommon in medieval churches, especially to the east and north of London, though it is friable so was often mixed with other materials. The building was reportedly wrecked in a storm and restored in 1362 thanks, it is said, to a papal Bull negotiated by the absentee rector, Sir David Gower, a Canon of St Patrick’s Cathedral, Dublin, that promised sinners a remission of penance for visiting Whitechapel with an offering. There were four priests in 1416 indicating a large congregation or at least a prospering parish. Documentation of legacies and archaeological investigation both point to fifteenth-century improvements, to the fabric of doors and windows if not more. [^2] Exceptionally, there were no chantries at the Reformation, when, in 1548 there were 670 communicants. [^3]Little is known about the form of the medieval church. It appears to have had a four-bay nave to which a three-stage crenellated tower and a north aisle and porch might have been fifteenth-century additions. George Birch’s claim from inspection of wall footings in 1876 that the medieval church was co-extensive with that of the seventeenth century seems doubtful, if only because it is known that a south ‘aisle’ was added in 1591. This was, it seems, separately roofed, and almost as tall as the nave, though not as wide, and possibly not as long. More a room than an aisle it would have generated not just more seating for a growing congregation, but also a much more auditory and less processional interior. That would have been in keeping with the Calvinist norms of the late sixteenth century that were strongly represented in east London and firmly upheld by Richard Gardiner (or Gardner), Whitechapel’s rector from 1570 to 1617. [^4]Protestantism had sparked early in Whitechapel, through the celebrated challenge Richard Hunne, a merchant tailor and probably a Lollard, had presented to the claimed rights of the rector, Thomas Dryfield, in 1511, and through John Harrydance, the Whitechapel bricklayer, arrested in 1539 for preaching from his window. [^5] Gardiner, in whose time the vestry sold off the church organ, was prominent among Elizabethan puritans and was embroiled in high-level religious–political controversy in the immediate run up to the extension of his church in 1591. [^6]Seventeenth-century ructions and rebuildingIn 1618 William Crashawe, an outspoken and leading London puritan, became Whitechapel’s rector, a posting that brought him upwards of £32 a year. He oversaw the insertion of a gallery in the south aisle which suggests that capacity was already again stretched. It bore a panel to commemorate the failure in 1623 of the Spanish Match. Crashawe died in 1626, preceded by 1,100 of his parishioners in the plague year of 1625. His successor in what his will called the ‘too greate Parishe’ of Whitechapel was John Johnson, another puritan, but one who married the daughter (Judith Meggs) of a wealthy parishioner in 1627 and trimmed thereafter to align with the Laudian tide. [^7] Johnson moved the communion table to the east end of the church, and undertook repairs in 1633–4 with £300 raised from parishioners and more from the Haberdashers’ Company, which in making the grant took into account the relative poverty of the parish. These works left the church ‘within and without, and in every part of it, Richly and very worthily beautify’d’. [^8]Johnson was among the first London clergy to be deprived of his living in 1641. Laud had strong local opposition. In the early 1640s Thomas Lambe’s General Baptists formed in Whitechapel what was at the time ‘easily the most visible and notorious of all sectarian congregations in London’. [^9] After contested elections for parish overseers and violent confrontations in the church in 1646, Whitechapel’s Independents gained control and gathered under a new rector, Thomas Walley (or Whalley). When the tables turned in 1660 Johnson was reinstated and a schism resulted, most of the congregation departing to a meeting house in Brick Lane. In 1662 Walley was arrested preaching elsewhere in Whitechapel; he soon after emigrated to New England. [^10] Johnson was revealed as corrupt and deprived of his living in 1668, chiefly through the agency of his son-in-law, Ralph Davenant, who became the next rector of Whitechapel. A fellow of Trinity Hall, Cambridge, and a descendant of Bishop John Davenant, the moderate Calvinist who had represented the English church at the synod of Dort in 1618, he was also a cousin to Thomas Fuller. [^11]The largely medieval church was rebuilt in 1672–3. Davenant and the vestry came to an agreement about the project in January 1672 and work was probably complete by the end of 1673 which date was carried on a stone tablet that remained on the east side of the tower through subsequent rebuilds. The principal benefactor was William Meggs, who had the parish’s largest house\\xa0where Johnson, his brother-in-law, had lodged in the 1650s. Meggs had been a member of Johnson’s vestry from 1660. These links with Johnson notwithstanding, Crashawe’s panel of 1623 was relocated onto the new south gallery and a monument to Crashawe himelf was conspicuously re-erected on the north wall. Puritan inheritance was not obscured. [^12] In its architectural form the new brick-built church represented a rapprochement with moderate Nonconformity. It reused some old footings and lower parts of the tower, but in its regular cross-in-rectangle plan, 90ft by 63ft, with shallow transept projections and angle quoins, it closely followed pre-Restoration Calvinist models at Westminster Broadway and Poplar. High-level round windows to north, south and east, perhaps derived from Inigo Jones’s work of the 1630s at St Paul’s Cathedral. The Serliana to the west also had pre-Restoration precedents in London. There were transept pediments to north and south, segmental pediments above inner-bay entrances to the north and pine-cone finials. The less prominent south side was more humbly finished, with an outer-bay entrance. The west door had rusticated pilasters, cherub-head capitals and a pediment. Architects and builders remain unknown, but there are circumstantial reasons for suspecting involvement on the part of Robert Hooke. [^13] The assuredly if impurely classical auditory interior was ‘very lightsome and spacious’. [^14] The main east-west axis was emphasized by three ribbed cross vaults supported by four Portland stone Corinthian columns, their bases obscured by box pews. There was a step up to the chancel, otherwise only articulated by the inclusion of flanking vestries. A ‘Corinthian’ altarpiece was ‘much enriched’. Shallow north and south galleries were probably original. A large black-and-white marble aedicular mural monument to Meggs was erected after his death in 1678. [^15]Church of St Mary Matfelon, plan as rebuilt in the 1670sVicissitudes, alterations and repairs, 1700 to 1860Davenant was succeeded in 1681 by Dr William Payne, a latitudinarian, fellow of the Royal Society and leading Whig among London clergy who was keen to embrace dissenters. The living was reduced by the loss of Wapping from the parish in 1694, and the liturgical politics of Whitechapel changed dramatically in 1697 with the appointment of the Rev. Richard Welton, a high-church Tory and Jacobite. Welton attacked Nonconformity and spurned the area’s recent Huguenot immigrants: ‘This set of rabble are the very offal of the earth, who cannot be content to be safe here from that justice and beggary from which they fled, and to be fattened on what belongs to the poor of our own land to grow rich at our expense, but must needs rob us of our religion too.’ [^16] He made beautifying alterations, moving the font and altering pews, oversaw the casting of six new bells by Phelps’s local foundry in 1709, and attracted high-profile controversy in 1713 when he placed a painting of the Last Supper by John Fellowes in the church as an altarpiece. Judas was prominently represented as a likeness of Bishop White Kennett, an antagonist of Welton’s. Through the Bishop of London, Kennett saw to the altarpiece’s removal in 1714. The same phase of works included an organ by Christopher Schreider, perhaps also the west gallery in which it stood. The organ case was later described as ‘carved and gilt, with carved oak trusses and gilt cherubim, surmounted by four richly-carved and gilt figures’ [^17] The gallery front sported a finely carved wood panel depicting King David playing the harp flanked by musical instruments. This survives close by in the church of St Botolph Aldgate. Refusing to swear loyalty to the Hanoverian succession, Welton was deprived of his position in 1715. His painting was thereafter replaced with figures of Moses and Aaron. A square window above was given a painted glory. [^18]The advowson had been purchased from Stepney by Brasenose College, Oxford, in 1711 when the Commissioners for Building Fifty New Churches decided that Whitechapel needed two more churches. [^19] These did not materialize, but under a succession of latitudinarian rectors Whitechapel’s church appears to have steered clear of further controversy making it a quieter but duller place. It was ‘repaired and Beautified’ in 1735 and again repaired, in what was a wealthy parish, with funds raised through an Act of Parliament in 1762–3 when the tower, possibly unstable, was to have been cased in Portland stone – it was probably rendered instead. The clock stage gained aedicules and a large cupola took the place of the small bell turret. Similarities with the exactly contemporary St George’s German Lutheran Church on Alie Street suggest that the carpenter–architect Joel Johnson may have been in charge of this project. [^20]The pulpit was to be removed in 1771, but perhaps nothing was done – a carved oak pulpit on fluted columns was in situ a century later. [^21] There were repairs worth £2,000 in 1805, with seats in the galleries divided into pews. Then in 1806 the pulpit was moved and there were more repairs for £4,133 11 2½, with James Carr as surveyor. These works probably included a cornice on the tower. Structural repairs involving iron tie rods and costing £1,113 13 3½ followed in 1825–6, with John Shaw (the elder) as surveyor. Even so, the tower became dangerous. James Savage acted as surveyor for yet further repairs in 1829–30, for £1,686 8 4. In 1839 Edward Blore reported on the state of the church and recommended rebuilding. Discussion was adjourned for a year, but not resumed, the notion presumably deemed too costly. [^22] The tower was again repaired in 1865, and given a new cast-iron bell frame made by Mears & Co. At some point in all this the east window was replaced with an 18ft-tall arch-headed stained-glass Adoration of the Shepherds. [^23]From 1837 to 1860 the Rev. William Weldon Champneys was Whitechapel’s rector. An evangelical, he started with a congregation of about 100, in a population of 36,000, and by 1851 had built attendances up to more than 4,000 across three services on a Sunday. He brought numerous reforms to Whitechapel, from a Sunday School and Mothers’ Meeting, to a Coal Club and Shoe Black Brigade, attempted to convert Whitechapel’s many Jews, and battled cholera and house farmers. Champneys also divided the parish, founding three new churches (see pp.xx). [^24]Victorian rebuildingsAn inspection in advance of an intended redecoration led to another condemnation of the seventeenth-century church as structurally unsafe in 1873. The parish reluctantly geared up to spend £4,000 on essential repairs. Then, in June 1874, Octavius Edward Coope came to the rescue. Coope was a wealthy brewer, a founder of Ind Coope & Co. in Romford in 1845, which firm expanded to Burton-on-Trent in 1856. He had been an MP in 1847–8, but was unseated on grounds of bribery. After a long interval he was again elected to Parliament as a Conservative MP for Middlesex in 1874. With that newly acquired status, Coope stepped forward claiming to be a Whitechapel parishioner – Ind Coope & Co. had offices and a depot on the west side of Osborn Street, Coope himself lived in Essex and, when in London, on Upper Brook Street in Mayfair. He offered to pay up to £12,500 towards a new church, presenting plans by his architect nephew, Ernest Claude Lee, who had been a pupil of William Burges’s, for a red-brick and stone-dressed High Gothic Revival building to seat 1,400. The offer was initially accepted with great relief and joy, but Coope had soon to defend the proposed use of red brick, averring, wrongly, that ‘our great church architect Street invariably uses it’. [^25] It was in fact to James Brooks’s recent red-brick churches in Haggerston, St Columba and St Chad, that a Vestry committee led by the Rev. James Cohen, a converted Jew who had been Whitechapel’s rector since 1860, and subsequently spearheaded by Augustus William Gadesden, a sugar refiner, went for comparative inspection. They were not impressed, convinced in their dislike of red brick, and anyway keen to have a larger church. Overall costs were estimated to be about £6,000 more than Coope was offering. Cohen’s committee concluded in September, with diminished alacrity, that ‘it is expedient that the offer of Mr Coope be accepted.’ [^26] Rebuilding began in 1875 when Cohen was succeeded by the Rev. John Fenwick Kitto. The builder was John T. Chappell, of Little George Street, Westminster, work was completed in October 1876 and there was a consecration in February 1877. The upper stage of the tower and spire followed in 1878, built by Edward Conder of Kingsland Basin. The estimated total final cost had risen to about £30,000 of which it was later said around £10,000 came from public subscription, the rest from Coope. [^27]The large brick church comprised a nave (109ft long and 78ft high) and aisles, a round-apsed chancel, a baptistery under a west gallery and a three-stage north-west tower with an octagonal spire and corner turrets rising 175ft in all, sited so as to be prominent on the main road. It extended further west and south than had its predecessor and was set less squarely to the road, to minimise disturbance of the graveyard and avoid building on southerly ground that was only leasehold. While adhering to red brick, Lee had amended his plans. The church had only 1,250 sittings and omitted a full-height north transept in favour of a gabled organ bay at the east end of the north aisle. An unusual feature, reflecting the local mission and a memorial to Champneys, was an external pulpit, placed on a staircase turret at the north-west corner of the nave. There was a large ‘church room’ to the south-east in which relics from the old church were displayed. The interior had ornamentally carved Bath stone dressings to naked brick surfaces (perhaps intended for decoration), Minton floor tiles and a ceiled wagon-vault, a form chosen for auditory reasons, ill-advisedly as the building had very poor acoustics. The old clock and bells were reset. Lee deployed thirteenth-century style details and himself designed fittings including the pulpit, lectern, font and a mosaic apse floor, executed by Burke & Co. of Regent Street. Horatio Walter Lonsdale, Lee’s brother-in-law, supplied stained-glass windows. Stone carving was by Thomas Earp of Lambeth. [^28]This church was short-lived, suddenly gutted by fire on a summer’s Thursday afternoon, on 27 August 1880. Flames in the organ chamber swept up the organ pipes into the timber roof. The tower survived. Kitto and Gadesden led an approach to Coope, still an MP, who undertook to use his influence to secure the insurance cover of £16,800 and to stump up further rebuilding costs. The acoustical shortcomings of the destroyed interior led him to make replacement conditional on a redesign by Lee. [^29] The church was rebuilt in 1881–2 on the same plan, but with a polygonal apse and an open pseudo-hammerbeam roof beneath a lower ridge which did bring acoustical success. The nave west wall was given three windows in place of two, and there were other detailed variations that favoured a style more characteristic of the fourteenth century. The interior was yet more richly sculpted than its predecessor, and this time lavishly decorated with stencilling that shows the influence of Burges. Conder was the builder and Lonsdale supervised painting and glass. [^30]The Church of St Mary Matfelon, around\\xa01920An alabaster reredos intended since 1878 was at last made in 1886–7 as a memorial to Coope. Carved by Earp, it represented the Last Supper and the Tree of Jesse, and stood in front of stencilled decoration of the early 1880s by Lonsdale that included large angels for the Twelve Gates of the Heavenly Jerusalem. [^31]Rebuilds notwithstanding, church attendance was lower than it had been under Champneys. It was estimated in the early 1880s to be around 1,500 on Sundays, albeit in a reduced parish with an estimated population of 14,000, the main impediment being what the Rev. Arthur James Robinson called ‘the old story of indifference’. [^32] Yet this was among the best attended of East London churches, with fully choral services and psalms chanted morning and evening. By 1884 Robinson’s team included two Missioners to Jews, the Rev. J. H. Bruhl and the Rev. A. Bernstein. The open-air pulpit was in regular use, and by the 1890s and well into the twentieth century special services were conducted for Jews in Hebrew and German, with sermons preached in Yiddish to congregations of up to 500. A last notable rector was the Rev. John A. Mayo, who gave the first radio sermon in 1922. [^33]The Church of St Mary Matfelon in May 1941St Mary’s Church was gutted once again, this time by fire bombs on 29 December 1940. The ruined shell of the building was cleared in 1952.

          "text": "Medieval churchesThe first church on the site that is now Altab Ali Park was built in the mid thirteenth century (by 1282), dedicated to Mary and from the outset identified as ‘de Matefelun’. This, which became Matfelon, may derive from a family name; Richard Matefelun, a wine merchant, is said to have been present in the area in 1230. If this is the derivation (matfelon as meaning knapweed is the least preposterous of numerous suggested alternatives), it was presumably in recognition of a pious benefaction, whether prompted by local need or not. It does seem clear that there would have been significant population growth in the area, and that the existing parish church of St Dunstan, Stepney, aside from being distant had been outgrown. Parish status was granted by 1320, the vicarage being in the gift of the Rector of Stepney. [^1]Archaeological evidence indicates that the church, always aligned to the adjacent road and not properly oriented, was of clunch or white chalk rubble. It thus, no doubt, came to be known as the ‘white chapel’, an appellation in use by 1344. Clunch was not uncommon in medieval churches, especially to the east and north of London, though it is friable so was often mixed with other materials. The building was reportedly wrecked in a storm and restored in 1362 thanks, it is said, to a papal Bull negotiated by the absentee rector, Sir David Gower, a Canon of St Patrick’s Cathedral, Dublin, that promised sinners a remission of penance for visiting Whitechapel with an offering. There were four priests in 1416 indicating a large congregation or at least a prospering parish. Documentation of legacies and archaeological investigation both point to fifteenth-century improvements, to the fabric of doors and windows if not more. [^2] Exceptionally, there were no chantries at the Reformation, when, in 1548 there were 670 communicants. [^3]Little is known about the form of the medieval church. It appears to have had a four-bay nave to which a three-stage crenellated tower and a north aisle and porch might have been fifteenth-century additions. George Birch’s claim from inspection of wall footings in 1876 that the medieval church was co-extensive with that of the seventeenth century seems doubtful, if only because it is known that a south ‘aisle’ was added in 1591. This was, it seems, separately roofed, and almost as tall as the nave, though not as wide, and possibly not as long. More a room than an aisle it would have generated not just more seating for a growing congregation, but also a much more auditory and less processional interior. That would have been in keeping with the Calvinist norms of the late sixteenth century that were strongly represented in east London and firmly upheld by Richard Gardiner (or Gardner), Whitechapel’s rector from 1570 to 1617. [^4]Protestantism had sparked early in Whitechapel, through the celebrated challenge Richard Hunne, a merchant tailor and probably a Lollard, had presented to the claimed rights of the rector, Thomas Dryfield, in 1511, and through John Harrydance, the Whitechapel bricklayer, arrested in 1539 for preaching from his window. [^5] Gardiner, in whose time the vestry sold off the church organ, was prominent among Elizabethan puritans and was embroiled in high-level religious–political controversy in the immediate run up to the extension of his church in 1591. [^6]Seventeenth-century ructions and rebuildingIn 1618 William Crashawe, an outspoken and leading London puritan, became Whitechapel’s rector, a posting that brought him upwards of £32 a year. He oversaw the insertion of a gallery in the south aisle which suggests that capacity was already again stretched. It bore a panel to commemorate the failure in 1623 of the Spanish Match. Crashawe died in 1626, preceded by 1,100 of his parishioners in the plague year of 1625. His successor in what his will called the ‘too greate Parishe’ of Whitechapel was John Johnson, another puritan, but one who married the daughter (Judith Meggs) of a wealthy parishioner in 1627 and trimmed thereafter to align with the Laudian tide. [^7] Johnson moved the communion table to the east end of the church, and undertook repairs in 1633–4 with £300 raised from parishioners and more from the Haberdashers’ Company, which in making the grant took into account the relative poverty of the parish. These works left the church ‘within and without, and in every part of it, Richly and very worthily beautify’d’. [^8]Johnson was among the first London clergy to be deprived of his living in 1641. Laud had strong local opposition. In the early 1640s Thomas Lambe’s General Baptists formed in Whitechapel what was at the time ‘easily the most visible and notorious of all sectarian congregations in London’. [^9] After contested elections for parish overseers and violent confrontations in the church in 1646, Whitechapel’s Independents gained control and gathered under a new rector, Thomas Walley (or Whalley). When the tables turned in 1660 Johnson was reinstated and a schism resulted, most of the congregation departing to a meeting house in Brick Lane. In 1662 Walley was arrested preaching elsewhere in Whitechapel; he soon after emigrated to New England. [^10] Johnson was revealed as corrupt and deprived of his living in 1668, chiefly through the agency of his son-in-law, Ralph Davenant, who became the next rector of Whitechapel. A fellow of Trinity Hall, Cambridge, and a descendant of Bishop John Davenant, the moderate Calvinist who had represented the English church at the synod of Dort in 1618, he was also a cousin to Thomas Fuller. [^11]The largely medieval church was rebuilt in 1672–3. Davenant and the vestry came to an agreement about the project in January 1672 and work was probably complete by the end of 1673 which date was carried on a stone tablet that remained on the east side of the tower through subsequent rebuilds. The principal benefactor was William Meggs, who had the parish’s largest house where Johnson, his brother-in-law, had lodged in the 1650s. Meggs had been a member of Johnson’s vestry from 1660. These links with Johnson notwithstanding, Crashawe’s panel of 1623 was relocated onto the new south gallery and a monument to Crashawe himelf was conspicuously re-erected on the north wall. Puritan inheritance was not obscured. [^12] In its architectural form the new brick-built church represented a rapprochement with moderate Nonconformity. It reused some old footings and lower parts of the tower, but in its regular cross-in-rectangle plan, 90ft by 63ft, with shallow transept projections and angle quoins, it closely followed pre-Restoration Calvinist models at Westminster Broadway and Poplar. High-level round windows to north, south and east, perhaps derived from Inigo Jones’s work of the 1630s at St Paul’s Cathedral. The Serliana to the west also had pre-Restoration precedents in London. There were transept pediments to north and south, segmental pediments above inner-bay entrances to the north and pine-cone finials. The less prominent south side was more humbly finished, with an outer-bay entrance. The west door had rusticated pilasters, cherub-head capitals and a pediment. Architects and builders remain unknown, but there are circumstantial reasons for suspecting involvement on the part of Robert Hooke. [^13] The assuredly if impurely classical auditory interior was ‘very lightsome and spacious’. [^14] The main east-west axis was emphasized by three ribbed cross vaults supported by four Portland stone Corinthian columns, their bases obscured by box pews. There was a step up to the chancel, otherwise only articulated by the inclusion of flanking vestries. A ‘Corinthian’ altarpiece was ‘much enriched’. Shallow north and south galleries were probably original. A large black-and-white marble aedicular mural monument to Meggs was erected after his death in 1678. [^15]Church of St Mary Matfelon, plan as rebuilt in the 1670sVicissitudes, alterations and repairs, 1700 to 1860Davenant was succeeded in 1681 by Dr William Payne, a latitudinarian, fellow of the Royal Society and leading Whig among London clergy who was keen to embrace dissenters. The living was reduced by the loss of Wapping from the parish in 1694, and the liturgical politics of Whitechapel changed dramatically in 1697 with the appointment of the Rev. Richard Welton, a high-church Tory and Jacobite. Welton attacked Nonconformity and spurned the area’s recent Huguenot immigrants: ‘This set of rabble are the very offal of the earth, who cannot be content to be safe here from that justice and beggary from which they fled, and to be fattened on what belongs to the poor of our own land to grow rich at our expense, but must needs rob us of our religion too.’ [^16] He made beautifying alterations, moving the font and altering pews, oversaw the casting of six new bells by Phelps’s local foundry in 1709, and attracted high-profile controversy in 1713 when he placed a painting of the Last Supper by John Fellowes in the church as an altarpiece. Judas was prominently represented as a likeness of Bishop White Kennett, an antagonist of Welton’s. Through the Bishop of London, Kennett saw to the altarpiece’s removal in 1714. The same phase of works included an organ by Christopher Schreider, perhaps also the west gallery in which it stood. The organ case was later described as ‘carved and gilt, with carved oak trusses and gilt cherubim, surmounted by four richly-carved and gilt figures’ [^17] The gallery front sported a finely carved wood panel depicting King David playing the harp flanked by musical instruments. This survives close by in the church of St Botolph Aldgate. Refusing to swear loyalty to the Hanoverian succession, Welton was deprived of his position in 1715. His painting was thereafter replaced with figures of Moses and Aaron. A square window above was given a painted glory. [^18]The advowson had been purchased from Stepney by Brasenose College, Oxford, in 1711 when the Commissioners for Building Fifty New Churches decided that Whitechapel needed two more churches. [^19] These did not materialize, but under a succession of latitudinarian rectors Whitechapel’s church appears to have steered clear of further controversy making it a quieter but duller place. It was ‘repaired and Beautified’ in 1735 and again repaired, in what was a wealthy parish, with funds raised through an Act of Parliament in 1762–3 when the tower, possibly unstable, was to have been cased in Portland stone – it was probably rendered instead. The clock stage gained aedicules and a large cupola took the place of the small bell turret. Similarities with the exactly contemporary St George’s German Lutheran Church on Alie Street suggest that the carpenter–architect Joel Johnson may have been in charge of this project. [^20]The pulpit was to be removed in 1771, but perhaps nothing was done – a carved oak pulpit on fluted columns was in situ a century later. [^21] There were repairs worth £2,000 in 1805, with seats in the galleries divided into pews. Then in 1806 the pulpit was moved and there were more repairs for £4,133 11 2½, with James Carr as surveyor. These works probably included a cornice on the tower. Structural repairs involving iron tie rods and costing £1,113 13 3½ followed in 1825–6, with John Shaw (the elder) as surveyor. Even so, the tower became dangerous. James Savage acted as surveyor for yet further repairs in 1829–30, for £1,686 8 4. In 1839 Edward Blore reported on the state of the church and recommended rebuilding. Discussion was adjourned for a year, but not resumed, the notion presumably deemed too costly. [^22] The tower was again repaired in 1865, and given a new cast-iron bell frame made by Mears & Co. At some point in all this the east window was replaced with an 18ft-tall arch-headed stained-glass Adoration of the Shepherds. [^23]From 1837 to 1860 the Rev. William Weldon Champneys was Whitechapel’s rector. An evangelical, he started with a congregation of about 100, in a population of 36,000, and by 1851 had built attendances up to more than 4,000 across three services on a Sunday. He brought numerous reforms to Whitechapel, from a Sunday School and Mothers’ Meeting, to a Coal Club and Shoe Black Brigade, attempted to convert Whitechapel’s many Jews, and battled cholera and house farmers. Champneys also divided the parish, founding three new churches (see pp.xx). [^24]Victorian rebuildingsAn inspection in advance of an intended redecoration led to another condemnation of the seventeenth-century church as structurally unsafe in 1873. The parish reluctantly geared up to spend £4,000 on essential repairs. Then, in June 1874, Octavius Edward Coope came to the rescue. Coope was a wealthy brewer, a founder of Ind Coope & Co. in Romford in 1845, which firm expanded to Burton-on-Trent in 1856. He had been an MP in 1847–8, but was unseated on grounds of bribery. After a long interval he was again elected to Parliament as a Conservative MP for Middlesex in 1874. With that newly acquired status, Coope stepped forward claiming to be a Whitechapel parishioner – Ind Coope & Co. had offices and a depot on the west side of Osborn Street, Coope himself lived in Essex and, when in London, on Upper Brook Street in Mayfair. He offered to pay up to £12,500 towards a new church, presenting plans by his architect nephew, Ernest Claude Lee, who had been a pupil of William Burges’s, for a red-brick and stone-dressed High Gothic Revival building to seat 1,400. The offer was initially accepted with great relief and joy, but Coope had soon to defend the proposed use of red brick, averring, wrongly, that ‘our great church architect Street invariably uses it’. [^25] It was in fact to James Brooks’s recent red-brick churches in Haggerston, St Columba and St Chad, that a Vestry committee led by the Rev. James Cohen, a converted Jew who had been Whitechapel’s rector since 1860, and subsequently spearheaded by Augustus William Gadesden, a sugar refiner, went for comparative inspection. They were not impressed, convinced in their dislike of red brick, and anyway keen to have a larger church. Overall costs were estimated to be about £6,000 more than Coope was offering. Cohen’s committee concluded in September, with diminished alacrity, that ‘it is expedient that the offer of Mr Coope be accepted.’ [^26] Rebuilding began in 1875 when Cohen was succeeded by the Rev. John Fenwick Kitto. The builder was John T. Chappell, of Little George Street, Westminster, work was completed in October 1876 and there was a consecration in February 1877. The upper stage of the tower and spire followed in 1878, built by Edward Conder of Kingsland Basin. The estimated total final cost had risen to about £30,000 of which it was later said around £10,000 came from public subscription, the rest from Coope. [^27]The large brick church comprised a nave (109ft long and 78ft high) and aisles, a round-apsed chancel, a baptistery under a west gallery and a three-stage north-west tower with an octagonal spire and corner turrets rising 175ft in all, sited so as to be prominent on the main road. It extended further west and south than had its predecessor and was set less squarely to the road, to minimise disturbance of the graveyard and avoid building on southerly ground that was only leasehold. While adhering to red brick, Lee had amended his plans. The church had only 1,250 sittings and omitted a full-height north transept in favour of a gabled organ bay at the east end of the north aisle. An unusual feature, reflecting the local mission and a memorial to Champneys, was an external pulpit, placed on a staircase turret at the north-west corner of the nave. There was a large ‘church room’ to the south-east in which relics from the old church were displayed. The interior had ornamentally carved Bath stone dressings to naked brick surfaces (perhaps intended for decoration), Minton floor tiles and a ceiled wagon-vault, a form chosen for auditory reasons, ill-advisedly as the building had very poor acoustics. The old clock and bells were reset. Lee deployed thirteenth-century style details and himself designed fittings including the pulpit, lectern, font and a mosaic apse floor, executed by Burke & Co. of Regent Street. Horatio Walter Lonsdale, Lee’s brother-in-law, supplied stained-glass windows. Stone carving was by Thomas Earp of Lambeth. [^28]This church was short-lived, suddenly gutted by fire on a summer’s Thursday afternoon, on 27 August 1880. Flames in the organ chamber swept up the organ pipes into the timber roof. The tower survived. Kitto and Gadesden led an approach to Coope, still an MP, who undertook to use his influence to secure the insurance cover of £16,800 and to stump up further rebuilding costs. The acoustical shortcomings of the destroyed interior led him to make replacement conditional on a redesign by Lee. [^29] The church was rebuilt in 1881–2 on the same plan, but with a polygonal apse and an open pseudo-hammerbeam roof beneath a lower ridge which did bring acoustical success. The nave west wall was given three windows in place of two, and there were other detailed variations that favoured a style more characteristic of the fourteenth century. The interior was yet more richly sculpted than its predecessor, and this time lavishly decorated with stencilling that shows the influence of Burges. Conder was the builder and Lonsdale supervised painting and glass. [^30]The Church of St Mary Matfelon, around 1920An alabaster reredos intended since 1878 was at last made in 1886–7 as a memorial to Coope. Carved by Earp, it represented the Last Supper and the Tree of Jesse, and stood in front of stencilled decoration of the early 1880s by Lonsdale that included large angels for the Twelve Gates of the Heavenly Jerusalem. [^31]Rebuilds notwithstanding, church attendance was lower than it had been under Champneys. It was estimated in the early 1880s to be around 1,500 on Sundays, albeit in a reduced parish with an estimated population of 14,000, the main impediment being what the Rev. Arthur James Robinson called ‘the old story of indifference’. [^32] Yet this was among the best attended of East London churches, with fully choral services and psalms chanted morning and evening. By 1884 Robinson’s team included two Missioners to Jews, the Rev. J. H. Bruhl and the Rev. A. Bernstein. The open-air pulpit was in regular use, and by the 1890s and well into the twentieth century special services were conducted for Jews in Hebrew and German, with sermons preached in Yiddish to congregations of up to 500. A last notable rector was the Rev. John A. Mayo, who gave the first radio sermon in 1922. [^33]The Church of St Mary Matfelon in May 1941St Mary’s Church was gutted once again, this time by fire bombs on 29 December 1940. The ruined shell of the building was cleared in 1952.

          "text": "['Medieval churchesThe first church on the site that is now Altab Ali Park was built in the mid thirteenth century (by 1282), dedicated to Mary and from the outset identified as ‘de Matefelun’.', 'This, which became Matfelon, may derive from a family name; Richard Matefelun, a wine merchant, is said to have been present in the area in 1230.', 'If this is the derivation (matfelon as meaning knapweed is the least preposterous of numerous suggested alternatives), it was presumably in recognition of a pious benefaction, whether prompted by local need or not.', 'It does seem clear that there would have been significant population growth in the area, and that the existing parish church of St Dunstan, Stepney, aside from being distant had been outgrown.', 'Parish status was granted by 1320, the vicarage being in the gift of the Rector of Stepney.', '[^1]Archaeological evidence indicates that the church, always aligned to the adjacent road and not properly oriented,\\xa0was of clunch or white chalk rubble.', 'It thus, no doubt, came to be known as the ‘white chapel’, an appellation in use by 1344.', 'Clunch was not uncommon in medieval churches, especially to the east and north of London, though it is friable so was often mixed with other materials.', 'The building was reportedly wrecked in a storm and restored in 1362 thanks, it is said, to a papal Bull negotiated by the absentee rector, Sir David Gower, a Canon of St Patrick’s Cathedral, Dublin, that promised sinners a remission of penance for visiting Whitechapel with an offering.', 'There were four priests in 1416 indicating a large congregation or at least a prospering parish.', 'Documentation of legacies and archaeological investigation both point to fifteenth-century improvements, to the fabric of doors and windows if not more.', '[^2] Exceptionally, there were no chantries at the Reformation, when, in 1548 there were 670 communicants.', '[^3]Little is known about the form of the medieval church.', 'It appears to have had a four-bay nave to which a three-stage crenellated tower and a north aisle and porch might have been fifteenth-century additions.', 'George Birch’s claim from inspection of wall footings in 1876 that the medieval church was co-extensive with that of the seventeenth century seems doubtful, if only because it is known that a south ‘aisle’ was added in 1591.', 'This was, it seems, separately roofed, and almost as tall as the nave, though not as wide, and possibly not as long.', 'More a room than an aisle it would have generated not just more seating for a growing congregation, but also a much more auditory and less processional interior.', 'That would have been in keeping with the Calvinist norms of the late sixteenth century that were strongly represented in east London and firmly upheld by Richard Gardiner (or Gardner), Whitechapel’s rector from 1570 to 1617.', '[^4]Protestantism had sparked early in Whitechapel, through the celebrated challenge Richard Hunne, a merchant tailor and probably a Lollard, had presented to the claimed rights of the rector, Thomas Dryfield, in 1511, and through John Harrydance, the Whitechapel bricklayer, arrested in 1539 for preaching from his window.', '[^5] Gardiner, in whose time the vestry sold off the church organ, was prominent among Elizabethan puritans and was embroiled in high-level religious–political controversy in the immediate run up to the extension of his church in 1591.', '[^6]Seventeenth-century ructions and rebuildingIn 1618 William Crashawe, an outspoken and leading London puritan, became Whitechapel’s rector, a posting that brought him upwards of £32 a year.', 'He oversaw the insertion of a gallery in the south aisle which suggests that capacity was already again stretched.', 'It bore a panel to commemorate the failure in 1623 of the Spanish Match.', 'Crashawe died in 1626, preceded by 1,100 of his parishioners in the plague year of 1625.', 'His successor in what his will called the ‘too greate Parishe’ of Whitechapel was John Johnson, another puritan, but one who married the daughter (Judith Meggs) of a wealthy parishioner in 1627 and trimmed thereafter to align with the Laudian tide.', '[^7] Johnson moved the communion table to the east end of the church, and undertook repairs in 1633–4 with £300 raised from parishioners and more from the Haberdashers’ Company, which in making the grant took into account the relative poverty of the parish.', 'These works left the church ‘within and without, and in every part of it, Richly and very worthily beautify’d’.', '[^8]Johnson was among the first London clergy to be deprived of his living in 1641.', 'Laud had strong local opposition.', 'In the early 1640s Thomas Lambe’s General Baptists formed in Whitechapel what was at the time ‘easily the most visible and notorious of all sectarian congregations in London’.', '[^9] After contested elections for parish overseers and violent confrontations in the church in 1646, Whitechapel’s Independents gained control and gathered under a new rector, Thomas Walley (or Whalley).', 'When the tables turned in 1660 Johnson was reinstated and a schism resulted, most of the congregation departing to a meeting house in Brick Lane.', 'In 1662 Walley was arrested preaching elsewhere in Whitechapel; he soon after emigrated to New England.', '[^10] Johnson was revealed as corrupt and deprived of his living in 1668, chiefly through the agency of his son-in-law, Ralph Davenant, who became the next rector of Whitechapel.', 'A fellow of Trinity Hall, Cambridge, and a descendant of Bishop John Davenant, the moderate Calvinist who had represented the English church at the synod of Dort in 1618, he was also a cousin to Thomas Fuller.', '[^11]The largely medieval church was rebuilt in 1672–3.', 'Davenant and the vestry came to an agreement about the project in January 1672 and work was probably complete by the end of 1673 which date was carried on a stone tablet that remained on the east side of the tower through subsequent rebuilds.', 'The principal benefactor was William Meggs, who had the parish’s largest house\\xa0where Johnson, his brother-in-law, had lodged in the 1650s.', 'Meggs had been a member of Johnson’s vestry from 1660.', 'These links with Johnson notwithstanding, Crashawe’s panel of 1623 was relocated onto the new south gallery and a monument to Crashawe himelf was conspicuously re-erected on the north wall.', 'Puritan inheritance was not obscured.', '[^12] In its architectural form the new brick-built church represented a rapprochement with moderate Nonconformity.', 'It reused some old footings and lower parts of the tower, but in its regular cross-in-rectangle plan, 90ft by 63ft, with shallow transept projections and angle quoins, it closely followed pre-Restoration Calvinist models at Westminster Broadway and Poplar.', 'High-level round windows to north, south and east, perhaps derived from Inigo Jones’s work of the 1630s at St Paul’s Cathedral.', 'The Serliana to the west also had pre-Restoration precedents in London.', 'There were transept pediments to north and south, segmental pediments above inner-bay entrances to the north and pine-cone finials.', 'The less prominent south side was more humbly finished, with an outer-bay entrance.', 'The west door had rusticated pilasters, cherub-head capitals and a pediment.', 'Architects and builders remain unknown, but there are circumstantial reasons for suspecting involvement on the part of Robert Hooke.', '[^13] The assuredly if impurely classical auditory interior was ‘very lightsome and spacious’.', '[^14] The main east-west axis was emphasized by three ribbed cross vaults supported by four Portland stone Corinthian columns, their bases obscured by box pews.', 'There was a step up to the chancel, otherwise only articulated by the inclusion of flanking vestries.', 'A ‘Corinthian’ altarpiece was ‘much enriched’.', 'Shallow north and south galleries were probably original.', 'A large black-and-white marble aedicular mural monument to Meggs was erected after his death in 1678.', '[^15]Church of St Mary Matfelon, plan as rebuilt in the 1670sVicissitudes, alterations and repairs, 1700 to 1860Davenant was succeeded in 1681 by Dr William Payne, a latitudinarian, fellow of the Royal Society and leading Whig among London clergy who was keen to embrace dissenters.', 'The living was reduced by the loss of Wapping from the parish in 1694, and the liturgical politics of Whitechapel changed dramatically in 1697 with the appointment of the Rev.', 'Richard Welton, a high-church Tory and Jacobite.', 'Welton attacked Nonconformity and spurned the area’s recent Huguenot immigrants: ‘This set of rabble are the very offal of the earth, who cannot be content to be safe here from that justice and beggary from which they fled, and to be fattened on what belongs to the poor of our own land to grow rich at our expense, but must needs rob us of our religion too.’ [^16] He made beautifying alterations, moving the font and altering pews, oversaw the casting of six new bells by Phelps’s local foundry in 1709, and attracted high-profile controversy in 1713 when he placed a painting of the Last Supper by John Fellowes in the church as an altarpiece.', 'Judas was prominently represented as a likeness of Bishop White Kennett, an antagonist of Welton’s.', 'Through the Bishop of London, Kennett saw to the altarpiece’s removal in 1714.', 'The same phase of works included an organ by Christopher Schreider, perhaps also the west gallery in which it stood.', 'The organ case was later described as ‘carved and gilt, with carved oak trusses and gilt cherubim, surmounted by four richly-carved and gilt figures’ [^17] The gallery front sported a finely carved wood panel depicting King David playing the harp flanked by musical instruments.', 'This survives close by in the church of St Botolph Aldgate.', 'Refusing to swear loyalty to the Hanoverian succession, Welton was deprived of his position in 1715.', 'His painting was thereafter replaced with figures of Moses and Aaron.', 'A square window above was given a painted glory.', '[^18]The advowson had been purchased from Stepney by Brasenose College, Oxford, in 1711 when the Commissioners for Building Fifty New Churches decided that Whitechapel needed two more churches.', '[^19] These did not materialize, but under a succession of latitudinarian rectors Whitechapel’s church appears to have steered clear of further controversy making it a quieter but duller place.', 'It was ‘repaired and Beautified’ in 1735 and again repaired, in what was a wealthy parish, with funds raised through an Act of Parliament in 1762–3 when the tower, possibly unstable, was to have been cased in Portland stone – it was probably rendered instead.', 'The clock stage gained aedicules and a large cupola took the place of the small bell turret.', 'Similarities with the exactly contemporary St George’s German Lutheran Church on Alie Street suggest that the carpenter–architect Joel Johnson may have been in charge of this project.', '[^20]The pulpit was to be removed in 1771, but perhaps nothing was done – a carved oak pulpit on fluted columns was in situ a century later.', '[^21] There were repairs worth £2,000 in 1805, with seats in the galleries divided into pews.', 'Then in 1806 the pulpit was moved and there were more repairs for £4,133 11 2½, with James Carr as surveyor.', 'These works probably included a cornice on the tower.', 'Structural repairs involving iron tie rods and costing £1,113 13 3½ followed in 1825–6, with John Shaw (the elder) as surveyor.', 'Even so, the tower became dangerous.', 'James Savage acted as surveyor for yet further repairs in 1829–30, for £1,686 8 4.', 'In 1839 Edward Blore reported on the state of the church and recommended rebuilding.', 'Discussion was adjourned for a year, but not resumed, the notion presumably deemed too costly.', '[^22] The tower was again repaired in 1865, and given a new cast-iron bell frame made by Mears & Co. At some point in all this the east window was replaced with an 18ft-tall arch-headed stained-glass Adoration of the Shepherds.', '[^23]From 1837 to 1860 the Rev.', 'William Weldon Champneys was Whitechapel’s rector.', 'An evangelical, he started with a congregation of about 100, in a population of 36,000, and by 1851 had built attendances up to more than 4,000 across three services on a Sunday.', 'He brought numerous reforms to Whitechapel, from a Sunday School and Mothers’ Meeting, to a Coal Club and Shoe Black Brigade, attempted to convert Whitechapel’s many Jews, and battled cholera and house farmers.', 'Champneys also divided the parish, founding three new churches (see pp.xx).', '[^24]Victorian rebuildingsAn inspection in advance of an intended redecoration led to another condemnation of the seventeenth-century church as structurally unsafe in 1873.', 'The parish reluctantly geared up to spend £4,000 on essential repairs.', 'Then, in June 1874, Octavius Edward Coope came to the rescue.', 'Coope was a wealthy brewer, a founder of Ind Coope & Co. in Romford in 1845, which firm expanded to Burton-on-Trent in 1856.', 'He had been an MP in 1847–8, but was unseated on grounds of bribery.', 'After a long interval he was again elected to Parliament as a Conservative MP for Middlesex in 1874.', 'With that newly acquired status, Coope stepped forward claiming to be a Whitechapel parishioner – Ind Coope & Co. had offices and a depot on the west side of Osborn Street, Coope himself lived in Essex and, when in London, on Upper Brook Street in Mayfair.', 'He offered to pay up to £12,500 towards a new church, presenting plans by his architect nephew, Ernest Claude Lee, who had been a pupil of William Burges’s, for a red-brick and stone-dressed High Gothic Revival building to seat 1,400.', 'The offer was initially accepted with great relief and joy, but Coope had soon to defend the proposed use of red brick, averring, wrongly, that ‘our great church architect Street invariably uses it’.', '[^25] It was in fact to James Brooks’s recent red-brick churches in Haggerston, St Columba and St Chad, that a Vestry committee led by the Rev.', 'James Cohen, a converted Jew who had been Whitechapel’s rector since 1860, and subsequently spearheaded by Augustus William Gadesden, a sugar refiner, went for comparative inspection.', 'They were not impressed, convinced in their dislike of red brick, and anyway keen to have a larger church.', 'Overall costs were estimated to be about £6,000 more than Coope was offering.', 'Cohen’s committee concluded in September, with diminished alacrity, that ‘it is expedient that the offer of Mr Coope be accepted.’ [^26] Rebuilding began in 1875 when Cohen was succeeded by the Rev.', 'John Fenwick Kitto.', 'The builder was John T. Chappell, of Little George Street, Westminster, work was completed in October 1876 and there was a consecration in February 1877.', 'The upper stage of the tower and spire followed in 1878, built by Edward Conder of Kingsland Basin.', 'The estimated total final cost had risen to about £30,000 of which it was later said around £10,000 came from public subscription, the rest from Coope.', '[^27]The large brick church comprised a nave (109ft long and 78ft high) and aisles, a round-apsed chancel, a baptistery under a west gallery and a three-stage north-west tower with an octagonal spire and corner turrets rising 175ft in all, sited so as to be prominent on the main road.', 'It extended further west and south than had its predecessor and was set less squarely to the road, to minimise disturbance of the graveyard and avoid building on southerly ground that was only leasehold.', 'While adhering to red brick, Lee had amended his plans.', 'The church had only 1,250 sittings and omitted a full-height north transept in favour of a gabled organ bay at the east end of the north aisle.', 'An unusual feature, reflecting the local mission and a memorial to Champneys, was an external pulpit, placed on a staircase turret at the north-west corner of the nave.', 'There was a large ‘church room’ to the south-east in which relics from the old church were displayed.', 'The interior had ornamentally carved Bath stone dressings to naked brick surfaces (perhaps intended for decoration), Minton floor tiles and a ceiled wagon-vault, a form chosen for auditory reasons, ill-advisedly as the building had very poor acoustics.', 'The old clock and bells were reset.', 'Lee deployed thirteenth-century style details and himself designed fittings including the pulpit, lectern, font and a mosaic apse floor, executed by Burke & Co. of Regent Street.', 'Horatio Walter Lonsdale, Lee’s brother-in-law, supplied stained-glass windows.', 'Stone carving was by Thomas Earp of Lambeth.', '[^28]This church was short-lived, suddenly gutted by fire on a summer’s Thursday afternoon, on 27 August 1880.', 'Flames in the organ chamber swept up the organ pipes into the timber roof.', 'The tower survived.', 'Kitto and Gadesden led an approach to Coope, still an MP, who undertook to use his influence to secure the insurance cover of £16,800 and to stump up further rebuilding costs.', 'The acoustical shortcomings of the destroyed interior led him to make replacement conditional on a redesign by Lee.', '[^29] The church was rebuilt in 1881–2 on the same plan, but with a polygonal apse and an open pseudo-hammerbeam roof beneath a lower ridge which did bring acoustical success.', 'The nave west wall was given three windows in place of two, and there were other detailed variations that favoured a style more characteristic of the fourteenth century.', 'The interior was yet more richly sculpted than its predecessor, and this time lavishly decorated with stencilling that shows the influence of Burges.', 'Conder was the builder and Lonsdale supervised painting and glass.', '[^30]The Church of St Mary Matfelon, around\\xa01920An alabaster reredos intended since 1878 was at last made in 1886–7 as a memorial to Coope.', 'Carved by Earp, it represented the Last Supper and the Tree of Jesse, and stood in front of stencilled decoration of the early 1880s by Lonsdale that included large angels for the Twelve Gates of the Heavenly Jerusalem.', '[^31]Rebuilds notwithstanding, church attendance was lower than it had been under Champneys.', 'It was estimated in the early 1880s to be around 1,500 on Sundays, albeit in a reduced parish with an estimated population of 14,000, the main impediment being what the Rev.', 'Arthur James Robinson called ‘the old story of indifference’.', '[^32] Yet this was among the best attended of East London churches, with fully choral services and psalms chanted morning and evening.', 'By 1884 Robinson’s team included two Missioners to Jews, the Rev.', 'J. H. Bruhl and the Rev.', 'A.

      "source": "We can now use these tags to build a more useful frequency distribution. To do this we're going to use a two new concepts - a *for* loop and an *if* statement.\n\nIn the code above where we made our first frequency distribution, we used a for loop to transform each word in word_tokens to lower case. Whilst we won't go into to much detail here, a 'for' loop is a piece of code which lets you repeat an instruction a number of times. An 'if' statement, on the other hand, allows you to execute an instruction only if a certain condition is met.\n\nIt's worth understanding a bit about what it means. In the next piece of code, we set up *fd*, a new variable which will store our frequency distribution information. Then we use a 'for' loop, which looks like this:\n\n```\nfor word in tagged:\n    ...do something\n```\n\nThis goes through every element of our tagged words one at a time, storing each one in a temporary variable called ```word```. Then, for each word, we check that it has one of the permitted tags (defined as a list in the first line), and make sure it's at least 3 characters long, which will help us discard punctuation and shorter words like 'a' or 'an':\n\n```\nif word[1] in permitted_tags and len(word[0]) > 2:'\n```\nTo put this in English - 'If the part of speech code of this word is in the list of permitted tags *and* it's longer than two characters, execute the following code'. Note that the *and* means both of these conditions have to be true - if both *are* true, only then does the following statement execute:\n\n```\nfd[word[0]] = fd[word[0]] + 1\n```\n\nWhich increases the count for that word. So, this code increases the count for a word if (and only if) it's at least 3 characters long, and it's of the correct tag.\n\nLet's see what it does:"
