      "source": "Spatial Network Graphs in Python\n==========================\n\nThis workshop comes out of research conducted on Chronotopic Cartographies (https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/chronotopic-cartographies/), a digital humanities project underway at Lancaster University in the department of English and Creative Writing. The project aims to create new techniques and tools to visualise the relationships between literature and space.\n\nOne of the tools we're using on this project are _graphs_ (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory). Graphs, in a mathematical sense, are networks consisting of 'nodes', or the points on the network, and 'edges', the lines which connect them. They are very useful for describing the relationships between things: nodes can represent any object or concept, and the edges which connect them how those objects are related.\n\nGraphs have many applications across a range of different disciplines. For example, Facebook uses graphs to model the relationships between people (ie. 'Duncan' 'works with' 'Becca').\n\nA very simple example of a graph, consisting of two nodes connected by a single edge, might be tabulated like this:\n\n|Node|Edge|Node|\n|---|---|---|\n|Lancaster ===>|Contains ===>|Lancaster University|\n\nOn Chronotopic Cartographies, we're using graphs to visualise the spatial structure of stories and poems. Following scholars like Franco Moretti, in recent years there has been a lot of work on _mapping_ literature: that is, using tools like Geographic Information Systems (GIS - https://www.esri.com/en-us/what-is-gis/overview) to show the relationship between fiction and the real world. Chronotopic Cartographies takes a different approach because stories aren't always mappable in this way. A text like _The Hobbit_, for example, takes place in a world which has has no correspondence with ours, whilst _The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe_ has passages which happen in the 'real' world and passages which happen in Narnia. Even in a realist novel like Charles Dickens's _Oliver Twist_, real-world locations are mixed with fictional ones. To truly map literature, we needed to find a way to represent these sorts of spaces.\n\nGraphs are particularly useful for this because they enable us to model what we might term 'story space': that is, to 'map' how the places which are referred to in a text or where action happens are related to one another without concerning ourselves with whether or not they can be mapped onto the real world.\n\nIn this workshop, you'll create a network graph of the spatial structure of an extract from _Sir Gawain and the Green Knight_. Along the way you'll learn some basics with the Python programming language, and learn how to use the GraphViz graph visualisation library.\n____\n\n## Part 1: Analysing Spatial Structure\n\nAs this workshop is about literary analysis first and Python second, we're going to start with a section of _Sir Gawain and the Green Knight_ and use some of the reading strategies that we've been using on Chronotopic Cartographies to analyse its spatial structure. As you'll see, whilst the passage you've been given has a clear spatial structure, there's some ambiguity to it, so each person's graph is likely to be slightly different. What we're creating, then, are not authoritative maps of the text, but of our interpretations of it.\n\n### Exercise: Identifying Spaces\n\nOn Chronotopic Cartographies, we're interested in two primary aspects of the spatial structure of texts: **settings**, or the places in the text in which the action happens; and **spatial references**, or the named places and topographic references in the text that are referred to but don't necessarily have action occurring in them. These will form the nodes of the graph that we'll create later in this workshop; the relations between them will form the edges.\n\n#### Settings\n\nA good way of thinking about **setting** is to imagine how you might stage or film a passage in a text: where is the scene occuring, and what sets might you need?\n\n- Read the extract from _Sir Gawain and the Green Knight_, and, with the person next to you, mark the places where you think the action occurs, or where the story moves from one place to another. \n\n- Once you've identified each setting, give each one a name.\n\n#### Spatial References\n\n**Spatial references** might be named sites ('Camelot' for example); or significant features in the landscapes described in the text ('the wilderness').\n\n- Go over the text and underline all of the spatial references and significant topographic features to which the text refers.\n\nWe'll use this passage later in the workshop; but before we can do anything with it, we need to cover some programming basics first.\n\n---"

On the project, we're using approaches derived from a sub-discipline of literary studies called 'narratology' (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narratology) to describe these relationships. However, for our purposes here, we can take a slightly more simple approach.\n\nWe can broadly categorise these relationships in the extract into the following categories:\n\n- 'Connects with': Describes the relationship between settings (ie. does the text indicate that one could physically move between two spaces).\n- 'Refers to': Describes the relationship between settings and named spaces (ie. is a named place referred to from a particular setting).\n\nThese relationships will form the edges of our spatial graph.\n\nRe-read the extract and:\n- List which settings are connected with one another\n- List which named places are referred to from each setting"

With a complex graph, for example, you can analyse which nodes are most significant in a network by measuring how connected each node is with those adjacent to it (used on projects such as Mapping the Republic of Letters http://republicofletters.stanford.edu/ to show who corresponded with whom); or perform a 'shortest path' analysis to determine how close one node on the network is to another. However, in this workshop we've covered the basics. \n\nIf you want to build on what you've learned here, there are resources below.\n\nGraphs:\n- GraphViz (https://graphviz.readthedocs.io/en/stable/manual.html): The full documentation for GraphViz, with many more examples of what you can do with it.\n- NetworkX (https://networkx.github.io/): Another tool for building graphs in Python. In some ways more flexible and easier to use than GraphViz, but only allows you to create and analyse graphs, not lay them out and display them.\n- Gephi (https://gephi.org/): A very full-featured tool for creating, analyising, and displaying graphs. Very useful for visualising large graphs created in NetworkX or GraphViz.\n\nPython:\n- The official Python documentation (https://docs.python.org/3/): Sometimes a bit difficult to understand, but the offical Python documentation is very comprehensive. \n- The Python Package Index (https://pypi.org/): Almost anything you can do with a computer you can do in Python, and someone will have written a library to help you do it. They are all listed here.\n- Stack Overflow (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python): Stack Overflow is a website where you can post questions about your code. Chances are, if you're finding something difficult, someone else will have too."
