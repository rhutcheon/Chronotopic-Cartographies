      "source": "Spatial Network Graphs in Python\n==========================\n\nThis workshop comes out of research conducted on Chronotopic Cartographies (https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/chronotopic-cartographies/), a digital humanities project underway at Lancaster University in the department of English and Creative Writing. The project aims to create new techniques and tools to visualise the relationships between literature and space.\n\nOne of the tools we're using on this project are _graphs_ (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory). Graphs, in a mathematical sense, are networks of 'nodes', or the points on a network, and 'edges', the lines which connect them. They are very useful for describing the relationships between things: nodes can represent any object or concept, and the edges which connect them how those objects are related.\n\nGraphs have many applications across a range of different disciplines. If you've ever encountered terms like 'the semantic web' or 'rdf', these are examples of graphs in Information Studies, whilst Facebook uses graphs to model the relationships between people (ie. 'Duncan' 'works with' 'Becca').\n\nA very simple example of a graph, consisting of two nodes connected by a single edge, might be tabulated like this:\n\n|Node|Edge|Node|\n|---|---|---|\n|London ===>|Contains ===>|The British Library|\n\nOn Chronotopic Cartographies, we're using graphs to visualise the spatial structure of stories and poems. Following scholars like Franco Moretti, in recent years there has been a lot of work on _mapping_ literature: that is, using tools like Geographic Information Systems (GIS - https://www.esri.com/en-us/what-is-gis/overview) to show the relationship between fiction and the real world. Chronotopic Cartographies takes a different approach because stories aren't always mappable in this way. A text like _The Hobbit_, for example, takes place in a world which has has no correspondence with ours, whilst _The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe_ has passages which happen in the 'real' world and passages which happen in Narnia. Even in a realist novel like Charles Dickens's _Oliver Twist_, real-world locations are mixed with fictional ones. To truly map literature, we needed to find a way to represent these sorts of relationships.\n\nGraphs are particularly useful for this because they enable us to model what we might term 'story space': that is, to 'map' how the places which are referred to in a text or where action happens are related to one another without concerning ourselves with whether or not they can be mapped onto the real world.\n\nIn this workshop, you'll create a network graph of the spatial structure of a text using of an extract from Sam Selvon's novel _The Lonely Londoners_. Along the way you'll learn some basics with the Python programming language, and learn how to use the GraphViz programming library.\n\n____\n\nPart 1: Python Fundamentals\n------------\n\n*Python* is a programming language used widely in scientific computing and on the web, but as we'll see, also very useful for approaching the sort of data that humanities researchers work with.\n\nThe particular flavour of Python we're using is *iPython*, which allows us to combine text, code, images, equations and figures in a *Notebook*, like this one. \n\nThis is a *cell*, written in *markdown* - a way of writing nicely-formatted text. \n\nContrast this with the *code* cell below, which executes a bit of Python. Select the cell, press the 'run' button in the toolbar and the result will be output below it."

When you run a cell in an iPython notebook, the computer (tries) to execute each instruction in order. \n\nThese instructions can broadly be divided into verbs and nouns: things which *do* things, and things which *are* things. In Python, the verbs can be *commands*, *functions*, or *methods*. We won't worry too much about the distinction here - suffice it to say, they are the parts of code which manipulate data, calculate values, or show things on the screen.\n\nThe simplest proper noun object in Python is the *variable*. Variables are given names and store information. This can be, for example, numeric, text, or boolean (true/false). These are all statements setting up variables:\n\nn = 1\n\nt = \"hi\"\n\nb = True\n\nNow let's try this in code. Run the cell below:"

You're then going to use the techniques you learned in the first half to create a spatial graph of your annotated text. As you'll see, whilst the passage you've been given has a clear spatial structure, there's some ambiguity to it, so each person's graph is likely to be slightly different. What we're creating, then, are not authoritative maps of the text, but of our interpretations of it.\n\n### Exercise: Identifying Spatial Structure\n\nIn the Chronotopic Cartographies project, we're interested in two primary aspects of the spatial structure of texts: settings, or the places in the text in which the action happens; and named places, or places in the text that are referred to but don't necessarily have action occurring in them. These will form the nodes of our graph.\n\nNamed places are fairly self-explanatory, but setting is a bit more complex. A good way of thinking about setting is to think about how you would represent a section of text if it were a play or a film: what sets would you need, and where is the scene occurring?\n\n#### Identifying Settings\n\n- Read the extract from _The Lonely Londoners_, and, with the person sat next to you, mark the places where you think the action occurs, or where the story moves from one place to another. \n\n- Once you've identified each setting, give each one a name.\n\n#### Identifying Named Places\n\n- "
